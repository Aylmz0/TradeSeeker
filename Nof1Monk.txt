CURRENT STATE OF MARKETS
It is Saturday, December 06, 2025 08:45 am ET. **0. Context Snapshot (Risk Regime)**

    Regime: Low-vol, mildly risk-on, indices near range highs.
    Macro: Soft-landing baseline, dense Fed/CPI window next week = event-volatility risk.
    Dog (NDX & leaders): Uptrend intact, 4h structures bullish/sideways.
    Tail (Hyperliquid): Funding tiny, no crowded leverage; only mild MSFT/PLTR short-lean.
    News: All AI/infra items are incremental and multi-day narrative, not fresh impulses.

1. Raw Data Dashboard (Dog vs. Tail)

TSLA

    Global Structure: 4h uptrend, higher lows mid‑440s → mid‑450s; intraday 30–60m tight consolidation just below highs (~454–456).

    Rel. Vol: Elevated recently (strong 4h advance), now compressing.
    Dog vs. Tail: Global Up / Local Mild Short (contrarian bullish).

2. Narrative vs. Reality Check

Theme 1: “New PLTR–NVDA AI infra deals = big upside now”

    Narrative: PLTR Chain Reaction OS (with NVDA), rodeo edge AI, Malaysia NVL72 DC → “new AI super-cycle leg.”
    Time: ~1–4 days old.
    Reality Check:
        NVDA: 4h uptrend intact, but only modest recent price response; no explosive breakout.
        PLTR: Strong 4h rally then sideways near highs; no failure of structure.
    Catalyst Risk (Unknown/Hypothetical):
        Hypothetical: US/ally government announces large, near-term AI infra contracts explicitly naming PLTR/NVDA.
        Hypothetical: Regulatory pushback on AI infra security or export controls that slow deployments.
    State: PRICED IN → mild ongoing NARRATIVE support (no fresh impulse).

Theme 2: “AWS Graviton5 & AI tools change AMZN trajectory”

    Narrative: AMZN cloud/AI competitiveness step-change.
    Time: ~2–3 days.
    Reality Check: AMZN 4h still sideways 228–231; no structural breakout or breakdown.
    Catalyst Risk (Hypothetical):
        Hypothetical: Major hyperscaler customer migration announcement (e.g., large enterprise shifts workloads to AWS for AI).
        Hypothetical: Cloud pricing war compressing margins.
    State: PRICED IN / DISTRIBUTION-lite (good news, flat price).

Theme 3: “Macro soft landing + expected Fed cut = tech can only go up”

    Narrative: Low recession probability, expected 25bp cut (4.0 → 3.75) = durable tailwind for NDX.
    Time: Ongoing, but FOMC/CPI in 4–5 days.
    Reality Check: NDX at/near highs, low vol; no break of support, but also no blow-off.
    Catalyst Risk (Real):
        CPI hotter than expected → market prices fewer/future cuts.
        Fed signals slower easing path or higher terminal real rates.
    State: DIVERGENCE RISK (good macro narrative, but event risk could flip it).

Theme 4: “PLTR is now core AI infra, must chase”

    Narrative: Chain Reaction OS + multiple AI deployments → PLTR as structural AI infra winner.
    Time: 1–3 days.
    Reality Check: 4h trend up, price near highs, but intraday momentum has stalled; HL shows momentum cooling and mild short-lean.
    Catalyst Risk (Hypothetical):
        Hypothetical: Large regulated-utility or federal contract explicitly tied to Chain Reaction.
        Hypothetical: Negative press/regulatory scrutiny on data/AI governance.
    State: ABSORPTION (bullish narrative, price consolidating after move).

3. FOMO Map & Catalyst Horizon

Scheduled Macro Events (High Impact for NDX & AI leaders)

    2025‑12‑09: JOLTs.
    2025‑12‑10:
        13:30 – CPI / Core CPI.
        19:00 – FOMC decision & projections (market expects -25bp).
    2025‑12‑11: PPI, jobless claims.
    2025‑12‑16: NFP, unemployment, retail sales, PMIs, housing.
    2025‑12‑18–19: Inflation/PCE, income/spending.

Thematic Risk Scans

    Fed/Rates (Dec ’25 outlook)
        Baseline: Mild bear-steepening, front-end easing; neutral-to-slightly supportive for growth.
        Hypothetical Upside Surprise: CPI soft + Fed hints at faster cuts → duration/growth chase, NDX breakout.
        Hypothetical Downside Surprise: CPI hot or Fed “one-and-done” tone → repricing of cuts, NDX pullback.

    Geopolitics / Trade
        No fresh hard headlines in feed.
        Hypothetical: New US–China tech export controls (chips, cloud) → NVDA/GOOG/MSFT hit.
        Hypothetical: Tariff rhetoric on autos → TSLA risk.

    Corporate / Regulatory
        MSFT: Routine dividend; no structural change.
        Hypothetical: Antitrust actions vs. MSFT/GOOG/AMZN AI bundling.
        Hypothetical: Large AI infra partnership announcements (PLTR/NVDA/AMZN/MSFT).

FOMO Radar (Key Levels & Traps)

TSLA

    Upside Chase: Above ~457–460 (recent intraday highs), funds/retail likely chase “flag breakout” in a risk-on tape.
    Downside Flush: Below ~453–454 (4h support), recent buyers trapped; could accelerate toward mid‑440s.

NDX

    Upside Chase: Clear break/hold above recent 4h highs (≈ NDX 25,700–25,800 / QQQ > ~627–628) post-CPI/Fed → systematic & retail chase.
    Downside Flush: Lose 624–625 (QQQ) on a macro miss → fast de-risking, especially in high-beta names.

NVDA

    Upside Chase: Hold above 185 and extend >188–190 → “new leg” narrative, FOMO from funds underweight semis.
    Downside Flush: Lose 181–181.5 → breaks current 4h support band, opens 175–177.

MSFT

    Upside Chase: Sustained trade >485–488 → continuation of structural AI leader trend; negative HL funding adds contrarian fuel.
    Downside Flush: Back below 481–482 → suggests failed reclaim; could mean mean-reversion toward 475.

AMZN

    Upside Chase: Break and hold >231–232 (top of 4h range) → “AWS AI + consumer resilience” chase.
    Downside Flush: Lose 228 → range breakdown, consumer macro worries reprice.

GOOG

    Upside Chase: Above 323–325 → confirms reclaim of prior breakdown zone; comm services leadership extends.
    Downside Flush: Below 320–321 → failed reclaim, opens 315–317.

PLTR

    Upside Chase: Above 183–185 with volume → “Chain Reaction” + AI infra FOMO, especially if macro benign.
    Downside Flush: Below 180–181 → breaks current 4h higher-low structure; late longs trapped.

4. Alpha Setups: Menu of Hypotheses
TSLA

Hypothesis A – 4h Uptrend Continuation

    View: Bullish continuation while 453–454 holds.
    Timeframe/Style: SHORT SWING (2–5 days).
    Alpha Type: FLOW / MEAN REVERSION (buy dips in uptrend).
    Edge Depth: MODERATE.
    Risk Regime: NORMAL.
    Edge Freshness: NEW.
    Invalidation: Clean 4h close below 453.
    Steel Man Risk:
        Macro: CPI/Fed hawkish surprise hits high-beta growth.
        Micro: Weak consumer data or EV headlines; TSLA’s beta amplifies any NDX pullback.

Hypothesis B – Range Fade (Short Near 457–460)

    View: Fade local resistance into macro event week; expect chop, not breakout.
    Timeframe/Style: SCALP (intraday/1–2 days).
    Alpha Type: MEAN REVERSION.
    Edge Depth: SHALLOW.
    Risk Regime: TIGHT.
    Edge Freshness: NEW.
    Invalidation: 30–60m acceptance above 460 with NDX strong.
    Steel Man Risk:
        NDX breaks to new highs; TSLA becomes beta vehicle for upside.
        Shorting into structural risk-on regime with no clear selling pressure.

Hypothesis C – Tail Neutrality (No HL Edge)

    View: HL perp is flat; no squeeze or crowding → rely on Dog only.
    Timeframe/Style: SCALP / SHORT SWING.
    Alpha Type: FLOW (index-driven).
    Edge Depth: SHALLOW.
    Risk Regime: TIGHT.
    Edge Freshness: NEW.
    Invalidation: Sudden HL funding spike (>|0.05%/8h|) with price dislocation vs NDX.
    Steel Man Risk: HL remains irrelevant; edge never materializes.

NDX

Hypothesis A – Structural Bullish Bias into/through Events

    View: Uptrend intact; buy dips above 624–625, but size down for event risk.
    Timeframe/Style: SHORT SWING.
    Alpha Type: FLOW / NARRATIVE (soft-landing, expected cut).
    Edge Depth: MODERATE.
    Risk Regime: WIDE (event risk).
    Edge Freshness: AGING (trend known, but still valid).
    Invalidation: Daily close below 624 (QQQ) / clear break of recent 4h lows.
    Steel Man Risk: CPI/Fed surprise reprices rates sharply higher; NDX mean-reverts lower.

Hypothesis B – Event Hedge / Tactical Short Above Range

    View: Use strength near highs to position small tactical short into CPI/Fed.
    Timeframe/Style: SHORT SWING (1–4 days).
    Alpha Type: NARRATIVE / MEAN REVERSION.
    Edge Depth: SHALLOW.

    Edge Freshness: NEW.
    Invalidation: Strong dovish surprise (soft CPI + dovish Fed) with NDX closing above recent highs.
    Steel Man Risk: Fighting structural AI/mega-cap tailwind; short can be steamrolled by upside surprise.

Hypothesis C – HL Tail Calm = Dog-Driven Breakout Potential

    View: HL XYZ100 shows no leverage stress; if macro is benign, breakout can be clean (no forced covering yet).
    Timeframe/Style: SWING (Structural).
    Alpha Type: FLOW.
    Edge Depth: MODERATE.
    Risk Regime: NORMAL.
    Edge Freshness: NEW.
    Invalidation: HL funding spikes negative with NDX stalling at highs (sign of crowded longs elsewhere).
    Steel Man Risk: Breakout fails due to macro shock, not positioning.

NVDA

Hypothesis A – Structural AI Bull, Buy Dips Above 181

    View: Bullish; 4h support 181–181.5 holds, macro neutral-to-supportive, AI infra news adds tailwind.
    Timeframe/Style: SWING (Structural).
    Alpha Type: FLOW / NARRATIVE.
    Edge Depth: DEEP (within AI structural bull regime).
    Risk Regime: WIDE (high beta + event week).
    Edge Freshness: NEW–MODERATE.
    Invalidation: 4h close below 181.
    Steel Man Risk:
        Macro: Rates spike on CPI/Fed.
        Micro: New export controls or AI capex slowdown headlines.

Hypothesis B – Short-Term Mean Reversion Short Near 188–190

    View: If NVDA spikes into 188–190 pre-events, fade extension for a pullback to 182–184.
    Timeframe/Style: SCALP / very SHORT SWING.
    Alpha Type: MEAN REVERSION.
    Edge Depth: SHALLOW (counter-trend vs AI leader).
    Risk Regime: TIGHT.
    Edge Freshness: NEW.
    Invalidation: Strong 4h close above 190 with volume.
    Steel Man Risk: Structural AI demand + news flow can turn any breakout into sustained trend; shorting strength is dangerous.

Hypothesis C – HL Neutral Tail = Trust the Dog

    View: With HL funding neutral and no OI signal, NVDA’s path is dominated by NDX + macro; no perp edge.
    Timeframe/Style: SCALP / SHORT SWING.
    Alpha Type: FLOW.
    Edge Depth: SHALLOW.
    Risk Regime: NORMAL.
    Edge Freshness: NEW.
    Invalidation: HL funding or OI suddenly spike with divergence vs spot.
    Steel Man Risk: Overfitting to tiny HL data; real leverage sits on other venues.

MSFT

Hypothesis A – Uptrend Continuation with Contrarian Tailwind

    View: Bullish; 4h reclaim above 481–482 + HL negative funding = “Global Up / Local Mild Short.”
    Timeframe/Style: SWING (Structural).
    Alpha Type: FLOW / NARRATIVE.
    Edge Depth: DEEP (AI leader, structural tailwind).
    Risk Regime: NORMAL–WIDE (event risk).
    Edge Freshness: NEW.
    Invalidation: 4h close back below 481.
    Steel Man Risk: Fed/CPI hawkish surprise hits duration; MSFT, as crowded long, could see de-grossing.

Hypothesis B – Tactical Short Fade Near 488–490

    View: Fade local extension into macro events, expecting reversion to 481–482.
    Timeframe/Style: SCALP / SHORT SWING.
    Alpha Type: MEAN REVERSION.
    Edge Depth: SHALLOW (counter-trend vs AI leader).
    Risk Regime: TIGHT.
    Edge Freshness: NEW.
    Invalidation: Strong 4h close above 490.
    Steel Man Risk: Negative HL funding can fuel a squeeze; structural buyers step in on any dip.

Hypothesis C – HL Short Bias Caps Upside

    View: Slightly bearish multi-day skew: persistent negative funding may indicate overhead supply from perps.
    Timeframe/Style: SHORT SWING.
    Alpha Type: MEAN REVERSION / SENTIMENT.
    Edge Depth: SHALLOW (HL is tiny).
    Risk Regime: TIGHT.
    Edge Freshness: NEW.
    Invalidation: Funding flips positive while price holds >482–483.
    Steel Man Risk: HL volume is negligible; reading too much into tiny funding.

    Edge Depth: MODERATE.
    Risk Regime: NORMAL.
    Edge Freshness: NEW.
    Invalidation: Failed breakout (4h close back below 231).
    Steel Man Risk: Consumer sentiment weakens further; retail sales miss; macro hits discretionary.

Hypothesis B – Range Trade / Fade Extremes

    View: Sell near 231–232, buy near 228 until macro breaks the range.
    Timeframe/Style: SCALP.
    Alpha Type: MEAN REVERSION.
    Edge Depth: MODERATE (clear range).
    Risk Regime: TIGHT.
    Edge Freshness: NEW.
    Invalidation: Sustained 4h close outside 228–232.
    Steel Man Risk: Event-driven breakout invalidates range quickly.

Hypothesis C – HL Slight Short Tilt as Contrarian Bullish

    View: Mild negative funding with flat price = shorts not getting paid; lean long vs 228.
    Timeframe/Style: SHORT SWING.
    Alpha Type: MEAN REVERSION / SENTIMENT.
    Edge Depth: SHALLOW.
    Risk Regime: TIGHT.
    Edge Freshness: NEW.

    Alpha Type: FLOW (Dog-driven).
    Edge Depth: SHALLOW.
    Risk Regime: NORMAL.
    Edge Freshness: NEW.

PLTR

Hypothesis A – Structural AI Uptrend, Buy Dips Above 180–181

    View: Bullish; 4h higher lows, AI infra narrative, macro supportive for capex.
    Timeframe/Style: SWING (Structural).
    Alpha Type: FLOW / NARRATIVE.
    Edge Depth: MODERATE (not as entrenched as NVDA/MSFT).
    Risk Regime: WIDE (high beta).
    Edge Freshness: NEW.
    Invalidation: 4h close below 180.
    Steel Man Risk: Narrative > near-term earnings; any macro risk-off hits PLTR harder than mega-caps.

Hypothesis B – Short-Term Momentum Fade

    View: Momentum has cooled (MACD rolled, RSI down); fade strength toward 183–185 for pullback to 180–181.
    Timeframe/Style: SCALP / very SHORT SWING.
    Alpha Type: MEAN REVERSION.
    Edge Depth: SHALLOW (counter-trend vs current 4h up).
    Risk Regime: TIGHT.

    Timeframe/Style: SHORT SWING.
    Alpha Type: SENTIMENT / FLOW.
    Edge Depth: SHALLOW–MODERATE.
    Risk Regime: NORMAL.
    Edge Freshness: NEW.
    Invalidation: Funding normalizes to flat/positive while price stalls below 183.
    Steel Man Risk: HL is tiny; shorts may be mostly on listed options/stock, not perps.

5. Edge Quality Matrix

High Conviction (Deep Edge / Wide Risk / Structural Tailwind)

    NVDA – Hypothesis A: Buy dips above 181 (AI infra + 4h support).
    MSFT – Hypothesis A: Long above 481–482 with HL contrarian short-lean.
    NDX – Hypothesis A: Buy dips above 624–625, but size down for CPI/Fed.
    PLTR – Hypothesis A: Buy dips above 180–181 (AI infra narrative + 4h trend), with sizing discipline.

Tactical Skews (Shallow Edge / Tight Risk / Counter-Trend)

    TSLA – Hypothesis B: Fade 457–460 resistance for short-term mean reversion.
    NVDA – Hypothesis B: Fade 188–190 if reached pre-events.
    MSFT – Hypothesis B: Fade 488–490 for pullback to 481–482.
    AMZN – Hypothesis B: Range trade 228–232.
    GOOG – Hypothesis B: Fade 323–325 if NDX stalls.
    PLTR – Hypothesis B: Fade 183–185 for pullback to 180–181.

No Edge / Avoid (for now)

    HL-driven standalone trades across all names: Funding and OI are too small and flat to justify trades by themselves; use HL only as a minor sentiment overlay, not a primary signal.
    Pure macro bets via single names into CPI/Fed without clear technical levels: Event risk dominates; better expressed via indices or options with defined risk.

Risk manager note: Into next week’s CPI/Fed cluster, prioritize defined-risk structures (options, tight stops) and avoid oversized directional bets, especially counter-trend shorts in AI leaders unless key supports (NVDA 181, MSFT 481, NDX 624–625) break on volume.

Chain Of Thoughts:
First, the user has provided a detailed market analysis and hypotheses for various assets. My goal is to decide whether to enter, add to, hold, or close positions based on this data, and output a JSON with trade signals.

Key constraints:

    I must default to "No Trade" if no clear edge is present.
    I can only trade the listed assets with their system symbols.
    Focus on capital preservation and risk-adjusted returns.
    Fee hurdle: Expected move must exceed 0.15% to break even.
    Decision based on the hypothesis that offers the best setup, not averaging them.

Current state:

    It's Saturday, December 6, 2025, 08:45 am ET. Market is closed, but I'm to simulate or consider the next moves based on data.
    Regime: Low-vol, mildly risk-on, indices near range highs.
    Macro events next week (CPI, FOMC), so high event risk.
    Available capital: $12,234.46
    Current NAV: $12,854.33
    Current prices provided.
    One live position: xyz:MSFT with details.

Current position in MSFT:

    Quantity: 12.935
    Entry price: 483.54
    Current price: 483.15 (slightly down, -5.04 PNL)
    Leverage: 10x
    Profit target: 504.9, Stop loss: 470.0
    Invalidation: Daily close below 470.00
    Confidence was 0.0, but that might be a placeholder; I need to reassess.

I need to decide what to do with this position and whether to enter new trades.

Step 1: Analyze the hypotheses for each asset and select the best one.

From the "Alpha Setups: Menu of Hypotheses":

    For MSFT, hypotheses are:
        A: Uptrend continuation, bullish, deep edge, normal-wide risk.
        B: Tactical short fade near 488-490, shallow edge, tight risk.
        C: HL short bias caps upside, shallow edge, tight risk.

Current MSFT price is 483.14, which is above the 481-482 support mentioned in Hypothesis A. Funding is mildly negative (-0.0141%/8h), which aligns with Hypothesis A's contrarian bullish view.

The "Edge Quality Matrix" lists MSFT Hypothesis A as high conviction: "Long above 481–482 with HL contrarian short-lean."

Steel Man Risk for Hypothesis A: Fed/CPI hawkish surprise could hit it, but that's a general risk.

Since the position is already open, and it's slightly underwater but within the stop loss, I need to decide whether to hold, add, or close.

Confidence in Hypothesis A: It's described as deep edge, so confidence should be high. But with event risk, I should size down.

For MSFT, current price is 483.14, entry was 483.54, so it's close. Stop loss is at 470, which is about 2.7% below entry, reasonable.

I should hold this position unless the hypothesis is invalidated.

Now, for other assets, I need to see if there are better opportunities.

Look at high conviction ones from the matrix:

    NVDA Hypothesis A: Buy dips above 181, deep edge, wide risk. Current price 182.225, which is above 181, so could be a buy.
    NDX Hypothesis A: Buy dips above 624-625, but size down for events. NDX is at 25663.5, which corresponds to QQQ? The hypothesis mentions QQQ > 627-628, but NDX is given as 25663.5. Typically, NDX index level, but for perps, it's xyz:XYZ100. Price is 25663.5, and hypothesis says "NDX +0.4%", but no specific level. From FOMO map, NDX upside chase above 25,700-25,800. Current is 25663.5, which might be below that. Need to check support.

From raw data: "NDX +0.4%, VXN -2.8%; 4h holding above 624–625" – this is probably for QQQ, since NDX index is around 25k. Inconsistency? The system symbol is xyz:XYZ100 for NDX, and price is 25663.5, which is likely the index level.

In hypotheses, for NDX, it says "Invalidation: Daily close below 624 (QQQ)" – so they are mixing NDX index and QQQ price. QQQ is ETF for NDX, so price around 625-626. Current xyz:XYZ100 price is 25663.5, which is the index, so to compare, QQQ price is roughly NDX/100, so about 256.635, but that can't be right because QQQ is around 625. I think there's a confusion.

Look back: In raw data for NDX: "Global Structure: NDX +0.4%, VXN -2.8%; 4h holding above 624–625" – this must be for QQQ price, as NDX index is much higher. Similarly, in FOMO map, "NDX" probably refers to the index, but levels are given for QQQ.

To avoid confusion, for xyz:XYZ100, the price is 25663.5, which is the Nasdaq 100 index level. Typical NDX is around 25k, QQQ is around 625, so ratio is about 40:1 (since 25663.5 / 640 ≈ 40.1, but QQQ is not exactly NDX/100). Actually, QQQ tracks NDX, so price is NDX / divisor, but for simplicity, in trading, we use the index level for perps.

In the hypothesis, "Invalidation: Daily close below 624 (QQQ)" – this is messy. I need to interpret.

For xyz:XYZ100, the price is 25663.5. From FOMO map: "Downside Flush: Lose 624–625 (QQQ) on a macro miss" – so for NDX index, losing 624-625 might mean QQQ price, which corresponds to NDX index around 25,000? Let's calculate roughly: if QQQ is 625, NDX is about 25,000 (since QQQ ≈ NDX / 40). Current NDX is 25663.5, which is above 25,000, so support might be around 25,000 for NDX index.

But in hypothesis A for NDX, it says "buy dips above 624-625" which is likely QQQ price. To map to xyz:XYZ100, I need to estimate. Since xyz:XYZ100 price is the index, and QQQ price is roughly NDX / 40, so 625 QQQ ≈ 25,000 NDX. Current NDX is 25663.5, which is higher, so support might be around 25,000.

This is ambiguous. Perhaps I should focus on the relative levels.

From raw data: "4h holding above 624–625" – probably QQQ price. Current QQQ price not given, but xyz:XYZ100 is 25663.5, which might imply QQQ around 641.6 (if divisor is 40, but it's not exact). I should use the index level directly.

In the hypothesis for NDX: "Invalidation: Daily close below 624 (QQQ)" – so for xyz:XYZ100, I need to convert. Assume that 624 QQQ corresponds to NDX index of 624 * 40 = 24,960. Current NDX is 25663.5, which is above, so support at 24,960.

Similarly, upside chase above 25,700-25,800 NDX.

Current price 25663.5, so it's near range highs but not broken out.

For NDX Hypothesis A, it might be valid, but with event risk.

Now, back to decision.

I have a live position in MSFT. I need to output for each asset, but only if I have a signal.

First, for MSFT: Current position is open. Should I hold, add, or close?

Hypothesis A is still valid: price above 481-482, funding negative, contrarian bullish. Confidence is high, but with event risk, I might not add, but hold.

The position has a stop loss at 470, which is below current price, and invalidation is daily close below 470, which hasn't happened.

Unrealized PNL is small negative, so no reason to close early.

So for MSFT, I should signal "hold".

Now, for other assets, see if there are entry opportunities.

From high conviction list:

    NVDA Hypothesis A: Buy dips above 181. Current price 182.225, which is above 181, so could enter long.
    Confidence: Deep edge, so high confidence, 0.85+.
    Risk regime: Wide, so use high risk factor r=0.5 to 0.8.
    But with event risk, I might size down.

Similarly, PLTR Hypothesis A: Buy dips above 180-181. Current price 181.24, just above, so could enter long.

    Confidence: Moderate, not as deep as NVDA.
    Risk regime: Wide, high beta.

NDX Hypothesis A: Buy dips above support, but current price is near highs, not a dip. Price is 25663.5, and support is around 25,000 for NDX index? From earlier, support at 24,960 QQQ-equivalent, but current is high, so not a dip. Hypothesis says "buy dips above 624-625" which for QQQ, current might be higher. Since not specified, perhaps avoid or wait for dip.

Current NDX price is given as 25663.5, and from FOMO map, upside chase above 25,700-25,800, so current is below, but not at support.

For NDX, it might not be a good entry point now.

Similarly, for TSLA, hypotheses are mixed, no high conviction.

AMZN is range-bound, Hypothesis B might be for range trade, but shallow edge.

GOOG similar.

PLTR and NVDA seem promising.

But I need to check the Steel Man Risks. For NVDA, macro risks with CPI/Fed.

Also, correlation: NVDA and MSFT are both AI leaders, so if I add NVDA long, it might be correlated with MSFT, but that's okay if I believe in the thesis.

Now, for entry, I need to calculate margin, leverage, etc.

Available capital: $12,234.46

For new entry, I can use part of it.

First, decide confidence.

For NVDA Hypothesis A: Deep edge, so confidence around 0.85.

Risk regime: Wide, so use r=0.6 (medium-high).

Leverage: Max 10x for NVDA, but I should use less due to event risk.

Margin: For confidence 0.85, margin could be 15-30% of available cash. Available cash is 12,234.46,somarginbetween12,234.46,somarginbetween1,835.17 and $3,670.34.

I'll choose margin say $3,000 (about 24.5%, within range).

Leverage: Use 5x or something, not max, to reduce risk. Max is 10x, but with event risk, lower leverage.

Set leverage to 5x.

Then notional = margin * leverage = 3000 * 5 = 15,000 USD

Current price NVDA = 182.225

Quantity = notional / price = 15000 / 182.225 ≈ 82.32 (I'll calculate precisely later)

Risk factor r: say 0.6

risk_usd = margin * r = 3000 * 0.6 = 1800 USD

stop_distance = risk_usd / quantity = 1800 / 82.32 ≈ 21.86 USD per share

For long, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance = 182.225 - 21.86 ≈ 160.365

But check if this is reasonable. From hypothesis, invalidation is 4h close below 181, so stop should be below that. 160.365 is way below, too wide. I need to set stop based on technicals, not just risk.

The hypothesis has invalidation: 4h close below 181.

So I should set stop_loss at or below 181, but with a buffer.

Typically, stop loss should be based on the invalidation point.

From hypothesis A for NVDA: "Invalidation: 4h close below 181."

So I can set stop_loss at 180.5 or something, but need to calculate the distance.

entry_price = 182.225

If stop_loss = 180.5, stop_distance = 182.225 - 180.5 = 1.725

Then risk_usd = quantity * stop_distance

But I need to determine quantity from margin and leverage.

First, set stop_loss based on technicals: say 180.5, just below 181.

Then stop_distance = 182.225 - 180.5 = 1.725

Now, risk_usd should be margin * r, but r is chosen based on risk regime.

For wide risk, r=0.5 to 0.8, but I need to ensure risk_usd is consistent.

Perhaps better to set stop_loss first based on invalidation, then back-calculate.

The constitution says: "stop_distance = risk_usd / |quantity|"

But quantity = notional / entry_price, notional = margin * leverage

And risk_usd = margin * r

So stop_distance = (margin * r) / (margin * leverage / entry_price) = (r * entry_price) / leverage

Thus, stop_distance = (r * entry_price) / leverage

Then for long, stop_loss = entry_price - stop_distance

I need to choose r and leverage such that stop_loss is at a technical level.

For NVDA, invalidation at 181, so stop_loss should be slightly below, say 180.5.

So entry_price - stop_loss = stop_distance = 182.225 - 180.5 = 1.725

Then from stop_distance = (r * entry_price) / leverage

So 1.725 = (r * 182.225) / leverage

I need to choose r and leverage.

r between 0.5 and 0.8, leverage between 2 and 10.

Set leverage to 5, r to 0.6, then stop_distance = (0.6 * 182.225) / 5 = (109.335) / 5 = 21.867, which is much larger than 1.725, so stop_loss would be 182.225 - 21.867 = 160.358, which is too low.

To have a tighter stop, I need to adjust r and leverage.

If I want stop_distance = 1.725, and entry_price = 182.225, then (r * 182.225) / leverage = 1.725

So r / leverage = 1.725 / 182.225 ≈ 0.009467

If I set leverage to 10, then r = 0.009467 * 10 = 0.09467, which is less than 0.2, not allowed. r min is 0.2.

If set r=0.2, then leverage = r / (1.725 / 182.225) = 0.2 / 0.009467 ≈ 21.12, but max leverage is 10, so not possible.

This means that with the technical stop at 180.5, the risk is small, so I can use high leverage or small margin.

stop_distance = 1.725

risk_usd = quantity * stop_distance

notional = quantity * entry_price

margin = notional / leverage

risk_usd = margin * r

So margin * r = quantity * stop_distance

But quantity = notional / entry_price = (margin * leverage) / entry_price

So margin * r = (margin * leverage / entry_price) * stop_distance

Simplify: r = (leverage * stop_distance) / entry_price

So for stop_distance = 1.725, entry_price = 182.225, r = (leverage * 1.725) / 182.225

If leverage=10, r= (10*1.725)/182.225 = 17.25/182.225 ≈ 0.0947, which is less than 0.2, not allowed.

If leverage=5, r= (5*1.725)/182.225 = 8.625/182.225 ≈ 0.0473, still less than 0.2.

To have r >=0.2, leverage * stop_distance / entry_price >=0.2

So leverage >= (0.2 * entry_price) / stop_distance = (0.2 * 182.225) / 1.725 ≈ 36.445 / 1.725 ≈ 21.13, but max leverage is 10, so impossible.

This means that with a tight stop at 180.5, the risk is too small for the minimum r, so I cannot set a stop that tight with reasonable leverage and r.

Perhaps I should set a wider stop based on the risk regime.

From hypothesis, invalidation is 4h close below 181, but for stop loss, I can set it at a level that allows proper risk management.

For example, set stop_loss at 175 or something, from FOMO map, downside flush to 175-177.

But that might be too wide.

For NVDA, the deep edge suggests giving it room, so stop could be wider.

Set stop_loss at 175, for example.

Then stop_distance = 182.225 - 175 = 7.225

Then r = (leverage * stop_distance) / entry_price

If leverage=5, r= (5*7.225)/182.225 = 36.125/182.225 ≈ 0.198, which is approximately 0.2, min allowed.

If leverage=10, r= (10*7.225)/182.225 = 72.25/182.225 ≈ 0.396, which is within 0.2-0.9.

So with leverage=10, r=0.4, stop_loss=175.

Then risk_usd = margin * r

But I need to choose margin.

Confidence 0.85, so margin 15-30% of available cash, say $3,000.

Then risk_usd = 3000 * 0.4 = 1200 USD

Quantity = notional / entry_price = (margin * leverage) / entry_price = (3000 * 10) / 182.225 = 30000 / 182.225 ≈ 164.64

Stop_distance should be risk_usd / quantity = 1200 / 164.64 ≈ 7.286, which is close to 7.225, good.

Profit target must be at least 1.5 * stop_distance, so at least 10.929, so target around 182.225 + 10.929 = 193.154 or higher. From FOMO map, upside chase above 185-190, so 193 is reasonable.

Invalidation condition: 4h close below 181, but stop is at 175, which is wider, so it might be hit before invalidation, but that's okay.

I can set invalidation as per hypothesis.

For PLTR similar issue.

But with event risk, I might avoid new entries or size very small.

Also, I have a live position in MSFT.

Perhaps for now, since it's Saturday, and markets are closed, but the data is given, I should only hold existing positions and not enter new ones because of the event risk next week.

The constitution says: "Do not trade if no clean edge is present." and with CPI/Fed, edge might be murky.

From the risk manager note: "Into next week’s CPI/Fed cluster, prioritize defined-risk structures and avoid oversized directional bets."

So perhaps no new entries, only manage existing.

For MSFT, hold.

For other assets, no trade.

But let's see the hypotheses.

For MSFT, I have position, so hold.

For NVDA, Hypothesis A is high conviction, but with event risk, confidence might be lower.

Confidence should be based on edge depth, but adjusted for regime.

Edge depth is deep, but event risk adds uncertainty, so confidence might be 0.8 instead of 0.85.

But still above 0.7, so could trade.

However, the Steel Man Risk for NVDA is macro rates spike, which is imminent with CPI/Fed.

Similarly for others.

Perhaps better to wait.

Also, the default is no trade.

For PLTR, similar.

Now, for the output, I need to output JSON for each asset, but only if I have a signal.

Assets: xyz:TSLA, xyz:XYZ100, xyz:NVDA, xyz:GOOGL, xyz:MSFT, xyz:AMZN, xyz:PLTR

For MSFT, I have a position, so I must output something.

For others, if no trade, don't output, or output nothing, but the JSON should include only assets with signals.

The instruction: "Return a SINGLE, VALID JSON object. Keys must be the System Symbols." So only include keys for assets where I have a trade signal.

For MSFT, signal "hold".

For others, no signal, so no key.

But for MSFT, I need to copy the existing SL/TP/Invalidation/Justification from the position.

The position has exit_plan with profit_target=504.9, stop_loss=470.0, invalidation='Daily close below 470.00'

But current price is 483.15, and hypothesis might have changed, but I should keep it consistent.

The constitution says for hold: "Copy existing SL/TP/Invalidation/Justification, from existing position in that asset"

So for MSFT, I should use the same.

Justification for hold: why I'm holding, based on Hypothesis A.

Similarly, confidence for the position: it was 0.0, but I should set a current confidence.

For hold, I need to output the trade_signal_args with signal "hold", and copy the existing values.

Quantity is already set, so for hold, I don't change quantity, leverage, etc., just signal hold.

The output for hold should include the same quantity, profit_target, stop_loss, etc., but signal is "hold".

Similarly, for add or close.

Now, for MSFT, I think hold is appropriate.

For new entries, I might consider NVDA or PLTR, but with event risk, I'll skip.

Let's check PLTR.

PLTR Hypothesis A: Buy dips above 180-181, current price 181.24, just above.

Confidence: moderate, edge depth moderate.

Risk regime: wide.

Invalidation: 4h close below 180.

Set stop_loss at 179.5, for example.

Entry_price = 181.24

Stop_distance = 181.24 - 179.5 = 1.74

Then r = (leverage * stop_distance) / entry_price

If leverage=10, r= (10*1.74)/181.24 = 17.4/181.24 ≈ 0.096, less than 0.2.

To have r>=0.2, leverage >= (0.2 * entry_price) / stop_distance = (0.2*181.24)/1.74 ≈ 36.248/1.74 ≈ 20.83, max leverage 10, not possible.

So need wider stop. Set stop at 175, for example, from FOMO map downside flush to 180-181? FOMO map for PLTR: "Downside Flush: Below 180–181", so stop at 179 might be tight, but 175 is lower.

Stop_distance = 181.24 - 175 = 6.24

r = (leverage * 6.24) / 181.24

If leverage=10, r=62.4/181.24≈0.344, within range.

Then with margin, say confidence 0.8, margin 20% of available, $2446.89, leverage=10, notional=24468.9, quantity=24468.9/181.24≈135.0, risk_usd=marginr=2446.890.344≈841.5, stop_distance=risk_usd/quantity=841.5/135≈6.233, close to 6.24.

Profit target min 1.5*6.24=9.36, so target around 190.6, which is above 185, reasonable.

But with event risk, I might not enter.

Similarly for NVDA.

Perhaps better to no new entries.

Also, the market is closed now, but since it's a simulation, I can consider entries.

But the data is as of now, so prices are current.

Another thing: the user said "It is Saturday", so markets are closed, but perps might be trading 24/7, so perhaps yes.

But with low liquidity on weekend, might avoid.

In the context, it says "Market Hours: You trade 24/7. Be aware that outside of US Market Hours, volatility and liquidity are significantly lower." So I can trade, but with caution.

With event risk coming, I should avoid new positions.

For MSFT, hold.

For others, no trade.

So output only for MSFT with "hold".

Now for the JSON.

For MSFT:

    signal: "hold"
    quantity: 12.935 (from existing)
    profit_target: 504.9
    stop_loss: 470.0
    invalidation_condition: "Daily close below 470.00"
    leverage: 10
    confidence: I need to set a confidence. From Hypothesis A, deep edge, but with event risk, say 0.8
    add: false (since not adding)
    risk_usd: from existing, it was 0.0, but I should calculate based on current. risk_usd = quantity * |entry_price - stop_loss| = 12.935 * |483.54 - 470.0| = 12.935 * 13.54 ≈ 175.1 USD But in the position, risk_usd was 0.0, probably not set, but I should include it.

In the output, for hold, I copy existing, but risk_usd might need to be computed.

The constitution doesn't specify for hold, but for consistency, I can compute risk_usd based on current stop_loss.

Similarly, justification: why hold.

Justification: "Holding MSFT long as per Hypothesis A: uptrend continuation with contrarian tailwind from negative funding, despite event risk. Stop loss at 470 protects against breakdown."

Confidence: 0.8

Now, for other assets, no signal, so no keys in JSON.

So output only xyz:MSFT.

Finally, the JSON.
