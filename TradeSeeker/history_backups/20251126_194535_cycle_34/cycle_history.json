    "chain_of_thoughts": "I'm analyzing all 6 assets using multi-timeframe analysis (1h for structural trend, 15m for momentum confirmation, and 3m for entry timing). Starting with zero positions and $100 capital, I need to be selective given the weak volume conditions across all coins (volume ratios <0.32x average).\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.1874 > EMA20=2.1804, RSI 51.8), 15m bullish (price=2.1874 > EMA20=2.1744, RSI 59.2), 3m bullish (price=2.1874 > EMA20=2.1861, RSI 55.2). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume extremely weak (0.044x). No compelling edge.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.15169 > EMA20=0.1509, RSI 54.7), 15m bullish (price=0.15169 > EMA20=0.1509, RSI 57.6), 3m bearish (price=0.15169 < EMA20=0.1517, RSI 51.8). Mixed signals with 3m showing weakness. Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM_RISK with 3 conditions met, but volume extremely weak (0.064x). Not compelling enough.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bearish (price=1.078 < EMA20=1.1161, RSI 29.7), 15m bearish (price=1.078 < EMA20=1.088, RSI 39.4), 3m bearish (price=1.078 < EMA20=1.0852, RSI 35.1). All timeframes aligned bearish with oversold RSI. Volume is relatively better (0.312x) but still weak. Strong bearish momentum but oversold conditions suggest limited downside.\n\n**ADA**: 1h NEUTRAL regime (price=0.4179 ≈ EMA20=0.4178, RSI 49.7), 15m bullish (price=0.4179 > EMA20=0.4159, RSI 55.1), 3m bullish (price=0.4179 > EMA20=0.4173, RSI 56.6). Mixed signals with extremely weak volume (0.027x). No clear directional edge.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13 > EMA20=12.9343, RSI 54.0), 15m bullish (price=13 > EMA20=12.9258, RSI 58.3), 3m bullish (price=13 > EMA20=12.9897, RSI 55.2). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume extremely weak (0.084x). No compelling setup.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bearish (price=136.7 < EMA20=137.2753, RSI 47.2), 15m bearish (price=136.7 < EMA20=136.8811, RSI 47.5), 3m bearish (price=136.7 < EMA20=137.1563, RSI 41.4). All timeframes aligned bearish with extremely weak volume (0.028x). Strong bearish momentum but volume concerns.\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT**: Global regime is bullish (3 bullish, 1 bearish, 2 neutral) but all coins show extremely weak volume participation. This suggests low conviction moves and potential false breakouts. Given this is my first cycle and volume conditions are poor across the board, I'll observe rather than force trades. The weak volume ratios (all <0.32x, most <0.1x) indicate low institutional participation and unreliable signals.\n\n**DECISION**: No compelling setups with sufficient confidence given the extremely weak volume conditions. I'll hold and observe for stronger volume confirmation in future cycles.",

Mixed signals: 1h bearish but 15m+3m bullish. Counter-trend LONG opportunity with STRONG alignment (MEDIUM_RISK). Volume weak (0.29x) but counter-trade conditions met.\n\nPrioritization: SOL counter-trend LONG (strongest edge), ADA trend-following LONG (clean setup), then DOGE/XRP (weaker due to volume). ASTER SHORT continues to hold despite small loss - weak volume suggests lack of conviction in bearish move.",

All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (0.158x). Strong bearish momentum but coin in cooldown (1 cycle remaining). Cannot trade due to cooldown. HOLD.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4196 > EMA20=0.41807, RSI 52.1), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4189 > EMA20=0.41660, RSI 57.7), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4189 > EMA20=0.41842, RSI 56.3).

All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (0.215x). Strong trend-following SHORT opportunity.

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing market conditions with 3 open positions and LONG slots fully utilized. Current portfolio shows slight drawdown (-2.73%) with mixed performance across positions. Global regime remains bullish (4/6 coins), but I must respect position slot constraints.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.1924 > EMA20=2.1818, RSI 53.2), 15m BULLISH (price=2.1917 > EMA20=2.1779, RSI 61.5), 3m BULLISH (price=2.1949 > EMA20=2.1904, RSI 59.2). All timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume. However, LONG slots are full - cannot enter new long positions.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.15205 > EMA20=0.15102, RSI 56.2), 15m BULLISH (price=0.1521 > EMA20=0.15119, RSI 61.1), 3m BULLISH (price=0.15241 > EMA20=0.15207, RSI 59.8). All timeframes bullish but volume is weak (0.28x). LONG slots full - cannot enter.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.072 < EMA20=1.1112, RSI 29.0), 15m BEARISH (price=1.079 < EMA20=1.0856, RSI 42.6), 3m BULLISH (price=1.081 > EMA20=1.0803, RSI 49.4). Mixed signals with 1h+15m bearish but 3m showing bullish momentum. Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM_RISK with 3 conditions met. However, volume is weak (0.24x) and RSI near 50 suggests limited momentum.\n\n**ADA** (LONG position): 1h BULLISH (price=0.4196 > EMA20=0.41807, RSI 52.1), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4189 > EMA20=0.4166, RSI 57.7), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4193 > EMA20=0.41858, RSI 57.8). Position slightly underwater (-0.13) but all timeframes remain bullish. Reversal signals are only INFORMATIONAL (3m reversal). Thesis remains valid - hold position.\n\n**LINK** (LONG position): 1h BULLISH (price=13.02 > EMA20=12.9433, RSI 55.0), 15m BULLISH (price=13 > EMA20=12.9409, RSI 58.1), 3m BEARISH (price=13 < EMA20=13.0065, RSI 50.8). Mixed with 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. Position slightly down (-0.10). Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM_RISK with 3 conditions met. However, 1h trend remains bullish and volume is normal. Continue holding.\n\n**SOL** (SHORT position): 1h BEARISH (price=137.05 < EMA20=137.285, RSI 49.0), 15m BEARISH (price=136.83 < EMA20=136.915, RSI 48.4), 3m BULLISH (price=137.29 > EMA20=137.148, RSI 53.4). Position underwater (-0.57) with 3m showing bullish momentum against our short. However, 1h+15m remain bearish and funding rate is negative (-0.00006) supporting shorts. Counter-trade analysis shows HIGH_RISK with 2 conditions met. Continue monitoring but thesis remains valid.\n\n**POSITION SLOT CONSTRAINT**: LONG slots full (2/2), SHORT slots available (1/2). Cannot open new LONG positions. Only SHORT entries possible, but must be high-quality setups with strong quantified edge.\n\nGiven the constraints, no compelling SHORT setups with sufficient confidence. ASTER shows counter-trade potential but weak volume and mixed momentum. Better to hold existing positions and wait for better opportunities or slot availability.",

All timeframes aligned bullish but RSI overbought on 3m. Volume weak (0.32x avg). Strong trend-following setup but overbought conditions suggest caution.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.15205 > EMA20=0.15102, RSI 56.2), 15m BULLISH (price=0.1521 > EMA20=0.15119, RSI 61.1), 3m BULLISH (price=0.15366 > EMA20=0.15236, RSI 73.7). All timeframes aligned bullish but extremely overbought on 3m. Volume very weak (0.19x avg). High risk due to overbought conditions and weak participation.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.072 < EMA20=1.1112, RSI 29.0), 15m BEARISH (price=1.079 < EMA20=1.0856, RSI 42.6), 3m BULLISH (price=1.088 > EMA20=1.0817, RSI 60.3). Counter-trend LONG opportunity (1h bearish vs 15m+3m bullish). MEDIUM_RISK counter-trade with 3 conditions met. Volume weak but RSI recovering from oversold levels.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4196 > EMA20=0.41807, RSI 52.1), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4189 > EMA20=0.4166, RSI 57.7), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4232 > EMA20=0.41941, RSI 72.2). All timeframes aligned bullish but overbought on 3m. Volume normal (0.56x avg). Strong trend-following setup but overbought conditions.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=13.02 > EMA20=12.9433, RSI 55.0), 15m BULLISH (price=13.00 > EMA20=12.9409, RSI 58.1), 3m BULLISH (price=13.11 > EMA20=13.0269, RSI 70.4).

Counter-trend LONG opportunity but COOLDOWN ACTIVE - cannot trade. Volume normal but coin restricted.\n\n**Prioritization**: LINK offers strongest trend-following setup with volume confirmation.

Continue holding as counter-trend thesis remains valid.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4279 > EMA20=0.4189, RSI 61.8), 15m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 74.3), 3m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 80.8). All timeframes aligned bullish with very strong volume (ratio 2.18). Extremely overbought on 3m but trend intact.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=13.24 > EMA20=12.9642, RSI 64.0), 15m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 73.9), 3m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 79.3). All timeframes aligned bullish with very strong volume (ratio 3.48). Overbought conditions but trend continuation likely.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=139.19 > EMA20=137.49, RSI 58.5), 15m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 66.0), 3m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 75.0). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume (ratio 2.07). Healthy RSI levels across timeframes.\n\n**COUNTER-TRADE ANALYSIS**: Only ASTER shows valid counter-trend opportunity (LONG) with STRONG alignment (3 conditions met, LOW_RISK). Other coins are all trend-following bullish. Since we already have ASTER long position, no additional counter-trend entries needed.\n\n**POSITION SLOTS**: 1 long slot available, 2 short slots available. Given the strongly bullish market regime and aligned timeframes across most coins, I'll focus on high-quality LONG entries with the remaining slot.\n\n**TOP OPPORTUNITIES**: \n- SOL: Best risk/reward with healthy RSI (58.5 on 1h) and strong volume\n- LINK: Strong momentum but more overbought\n- ADA: Very strong volume but extremely overbought on 3m\n\nSOL offers the cleanest setup with room for continuation.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all 6 assets using multi-timeframe analysis (1h structural trend, 15m momentum confirmation, 3m entry timing):\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2225 > EMA20=2.1847, RSI 60.4), 15m BULLISH (price=2.2225 > EMA20=2.1842, RSI 74.4), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2226 > EMA20=2.2012, RSI 77.5). All timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume (0.71x). However, RSI overbought on 3m/15m and counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK. No counter-trend opportunity as all timeframes aligned.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.15494 > EMA20=0.1513, RSI 66.1), 15m BULLISH (price=0.15494 > EMA20=0.1518, RSI 76.0), 3m BULLISH (price=0.15494 > EMA20=0.1530, RSI 75.4). All timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume (0.57x). RSI overbought on shorter timeframes and counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK. No counter-trend setup.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.096 < EMA20=1.1135, RSI 40.7), 15m BULLISH (price=1.096 > EMA20=1.0877, RSI 53.5), 3m BULLISH (price=1.096 > EMA20=1.0850, RSI 67.6). This presents a STRONG counter-trend LONG opportunity (1h bearish but 15m+3m bullish). Counter-trade analysis confirms STRONG alignment with 2/5 conditions met and MEDIUM_RISK. However, volume is WEAK (0.11x) which reduces conviction. With 1 long slot available, this is viable but requires careful sizing.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4282 > EMA20=0.4189, RSI 62.0), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4282 > EMA20=0.4183, RSI 74.6), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4282 > EMA20=0.4216, RSI 79.8). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume is WEAK (0.30x) and RSI extremely overbought on 3m. Counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK. No counter-trend opportunity.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=13.28 > EMA20=12.9681, RSI 65.2), 15m BULLISH (price=13.28 > EMA20=12.9887, RSI 75.5), 3m BULLISH (price=13.28 > EMA20=13.0897, RSI 79.7). All timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume (0.62x). However, RSI overbought on shorter timeframes and counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK. No counter-trend setup.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=139.53 > EMA20=137.5211, RSI 59.7), 15m BULLISH (price=139.54 > EMA20=137.3274, RSI 67.8), 3m BULLISH (price=139.54 > EMA20=137.9002, RSI 77.3). All timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume (0.73x). Existing LONG position performing well (+0.42 PnL). Reversal signals show only 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL strength) - normal market noise. Position thesis remains valid.\n\n**Market Context**: Strong bullish bias across most assets with 5/6 coins in BULLISH regime. Position slots: 1 long used, 1 long available, 2 short available. ASTER presents the only viable counter-trend opportunity with MEDIUM_RISK rating. Given weak volume (0.11x), will proceed with moderate confidence.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Current market shows strong bullish bias with 5/6 coins in BULLISH regime. Position slots: LONG slots FULL (2/2 used), SHORT slots available (2/2). Must avoid new LONG entries and only consider SHORT opportunities with strong quantified edge.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2258 > EMA20=2.1850, RSI 61.1), 15m bullish (price=2.2337 > EMA20=2.1896, RSI 77.3), 3m bullish (price=2.2298 > EMA20=2.2135, RSI 70.8). All timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume. No counter-trade opportunity. LONG slots full - HOLD.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.15513 > EMA20=0.15131, RSI 66.6), 15m bullish (price=0.15555 > EMA20=0.15218, RSI 77.4), 3m bullish (price=0.15538 > EMA20=0.15403, RSI 71.0). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume. No counter-trade opportunity. LONG slots full - HOLD.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bearish (price=1.106 < EMA20=1.1144, RSI 44.5), 15m bullish (price=1.107 > EMA20=1.0904, RSI 58.9), 3m bullish (price=1.105 > EMA20=1.0935, RSI 69.3). Counter-trade analysis shows STRONG alignment (2 conditions met, MEDIUM_RISK). 15m+3m bullish vs 1h bearish = counter-trend LONG opportunity. However, LONG slots are FULL - cannot execute. Counter-trend signal invalidates trend-following SHORT setup. Must HOLD.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4282 > EMA20=0.4189, RSI 62.0), 15m bullish (price=0.4295 > EMA20=0.4194, RSI 76.1), 3m bullish (price=0.4291 > EMA20=0.4247, RSI 73.8). All timeframes aligned bullish. Existing LONG position performing well (+0.32 PnL). Reversal signal: 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL) but 1h+15m still bullish. Continue holding with original exit plan.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13.29 > EMA20=12.9690, RSI 65.5), 15m bullish (price=13.33 > EMA20=13.0255, RSI 77.3), 3m bullish (price=13.34 > EMA20=13.1909, RSI 75.9). All timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume. No counter-trade opportunity. LONG slots full - HOLD.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=139.58 > EMA20=137.5258, RSI 59.9), 15m bullish (price=140.06 > EMA20=137.6143, RSI 70.1), 3m bullish (price=140.47 > EMA20=138.8910, RSI 74.8). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume. Existing LONG position performing well (+0.51 PnL). Reversal signal: 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL) but 1h+15m still bullish. Continue holding with original exit plan.\n\n**MARKET SUMMARY**: Strong bullish environment with 5/6 coins in BULLISH regime. LONG slots are FULL (2/2), SHORT slots available (2/2). ASTER presents a valid counter-trend LONG opportunity but cannot execute due to slot constraints. No high-quality SHORT setups identified as all coins show strong bullish momentum across timeframes. Best action: HOLD existing positions and wait for better opportunities.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis:\n\n**MARKET OVERVIEW**: Strong bullish bias across most assets with 1h trends bullish for XRP, DOGE, ADA, LINK, SOL. Only ASTER shows bearish 1h structure. Position slots: 1 LONG used, 1 LONG available, 2 SHORT available.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2399 > EMA20=2.1910, RSI 63.8), 15m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 78.8), 3m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 75.2). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume weak (0.42x). RSI overbought on shorter timeframes. No counter-trend opportunity.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.15615 > EMA20=0.1518, RSI 69.1), 15m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 79.7), 3m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 76.3). Strong bullish alignment across all timeframes with normal volume. RSI approaching overbought but momentum intact.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.11 < EMA20=1.1144, RSI 45.9), 15m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 60.0), 3m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 70.9). Existing LONG position showing -0.37 PnL. Counter-trend LONG opportunity with STRONG alignment (15m+3m bullish vs 1h bearish). Volume normal, RSI reasonable. Position needs monitoring but counter-trade conditions favorable.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4315 > EMA20=0.4203, RSI 64.9), 15m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 78.1), 3m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 79.5). All timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume. RSI overbought on shorter timeframes suggesting potential pullback.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=13.38 > EMA20=13.0150, RSI 68.0), 15m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 78.9), 3m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 76.9). Strong bullish alignment but volume weak (0.42x). RSI elevated across timeframes.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=140.98 > EMA20=137.9556, RSI 64.2), 15m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 73.7), 3m BULLISH (price > EMA20, RSI 77.7). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume weak (0.36x). RSI approaching overbought on shorter timeframes.\n\n**PRIORITIZATION**: ASTER presents the strongest counter-trend LONG opportunity with STRONG alignment and MEDIUM_RISK rating. DOGE offers clean trend-following LONG with normal volume. Other assets show bullish alignment but weak volume and overbought conditions. Given 1 LONG slot available, will focus on ASTER counter-trend opportunity.",

STRONG counter-trend LONG opportunity with 3 conditions met, LOW_RISK rating. 15m+3m both bullish against 1h bearish trend. Volume weak but RSI reasonable.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4315 > EMA20=0.4203, RSI 64.9), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4326 > EMA20=0.4208, RSI 79.1), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4326 > EMA20=0.4282, RSI 75.3).

All timeframes bullish with normal volume. 3m RSI extremely overbought at 83.7 suggests potential pullback. No counter-trend setup.\n\n**POSITION SLOTS**: 1 LONG used, 1 LONG available, 2 SHORT available. ASTER counter-trend LONG qualifies as valid opportunity with LOW_RISK rating and strong alignment (3 conditions met). Given LONG slot availability, executing ASTER LONG.\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT**: Strong bullish bias across most coins with weak volume. ASTER provides the only valid counter-trend opportunity with favorable risk profile. LINK position continues to perform well in bullish conditions.",

All timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume. Strong trend continuation but RSI overbought on shorter timeframes.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.15615 > EMA20=0.1518, RSI 69.1), 15m BULLISH (price=0.15667 > EMA20=0.1530, RSI 81.1), 3m BULLISH (price=0.15667 > EMA20=0.1552, RSI 72.3). All timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume. Similar to XRP with overbought conditions on shorter timeframes.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.11 < EMA20=1.1144, RSI 45.9), 15m BULLISH (price=1.112 > EMA20=1.0944, RSI 60.9), 3m BULLISH (price=1.112 > EMA20=1.1033, RSI 66.3). This is a classic counter-trend setup with 15m+3m bullish against 1h bearish. Current LONG position is profitable (+0.38 PnL). Counter-trade analysis shows STRONG alignment with 3 conditions met and LOW_RISK rating.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4315 > EMA20=0.4203, RSI 64.9), 15m BULLISH (price=0.435 > EMA20=0.4222, RSI 81.2), 3m BULLISH (price=0.435 > EMA20=0.4289, RSI 79.5). All timeframes aligned bullish with STRONG volume (1.82x ratio). Very strong bullish momentum but RSI extremely overbought on shorter timeframes.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=13.38 > EMA20=13.015, RSI 68.0), 15m BULLISH (price=13.46 > EMA20=13.1023, RSI 81.4), 3m BULLISH (price=13.46 > EMA20=13.3048, RSI 75.6).

All timeframes aligned bullish with STRONG volume (3.99x ratio). Extremely strong momentum but RSI severely overbought on 3m timeframe.\n\n**POSITION SLOTS ANALYSIS**: Currently 1 LONG position (ASTER), 1 LONG slot available, 2 SHORT slots available. Market context shows strong bullish bias across most assets but overbought conditions. ASTER counter-trend LONG remains valid with LOW_RISK rating. No compelling SHORT setups as most assets show strong bullish alignment.\n\n**DECISION RATIONALE**: \n- Hold ASTER position as counter-trend setup remains valid with profitable PnL\n- No new LONG entries due to overbought conditions and limited edge\n- No SHORT entries as no valid counter-trend signals exist (all 15m+3m trends are bullish)\n- Wait for better risk/reward opportunities",

However, volume is weak across most coins except SOL. Position slots: 2 LONG positions active (ADA, LINK), 0 SHORT positions, 2 SHORT slots available.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.245 > EMA20=2.1915, RSI 64.7), 15m bullish (price=2.245 > EMA20=2.1995, RSI 80.0), 3m bullish (price=2.245 > EMA20=2.2330, RSI 66.1).

All timeframes aligned bullish with very weak volume (0.15x avg). No counter-trend setup. LONG slots full, cannot enter.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h bearish (price=1.109 < EMA20=1.1143, RSI 45.6), 15m bullish (price=1.109 > EMA20=1.0941, RSI 59.2), 3m bullish (price=1.109 > EMA20=1.1042, RSI 60.2). This presents a counter-trend LONG opportunity (15m+3m bullish vs 1h bearish). Counter-trade analysis shows STRONG alignment with 2 conditions met, MEDIUM_RISK. However, LONG slots are FULL, cannot execute this valid counter-trend LONG. According to rules, cannot force SHORT in opposite direction when valid counter-trend exists.\n\n**ADA** (existing LONG): 1h bullish (price=0.4352 > EMA20=0.4207, RSI 67.7), 15m bullish (price=0.4352 > EMA20=0.4222, RSI 81.3), 3m bullish (price=0.4352 > EMA20=0.4303, RSI 75.2). All timeframes remain bullish. Position is profitable (+0.71). Reversal signals show only 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL) - normal noise. Continue holding.\n\n**LINK** (existing LONG): 1h bullish (price=13.48 > EMA20=13.0246, RSI 70.6), 15m bullish (price=13.48 > EMA20=13.1042, RSI 81.9), 3m bullish (price=13.48 > EMA20=13.3421, RSI 72.9). All timeframes remain bullish. Position is profitable (+0.66). Reversal signals show only 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL) - normal noise.

All timeframes aligned bullish with NORMAL volume (0.98x avg). RSI extremely overbought at 87.3 on 3m, suggesting potential exhaustion. However, no counter-trend setup exists (all timeframes bullish). LONG slots full, cannot enter.\n\n**Summary**: No valid SHORT opportunities identified. ASTER has counter-trend LONG setup but LONG slots full. Existing LONG positions (ADA, LINK) continue performing well with bullish alignment across all timeframes.

When 1h+15m+3m all align bullish, counter-trend SHORT is invalid.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2464 > EMA20=2.1916, RSI 64.9), 15m bullish (price=2.2466 > EMA20=2.2043, RSI 79.0), 3m bullish (price=2.2467 > EMA20=2.2357, RSI 65.9). All timeframes aligned bullish. Volume extremely weak (0.06x). No counter-trend opportunity.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.15648 > EMA20=0.1519, RSI 69.8), 15m bullish (price=0.15648 > EMA20=0.1533, RSI 80.3), 3m bullish (price=0.15648 > EMA20=0.1556, RSI 66.9). All timeframes aligned bullish. Volume weak (0.15x). No counter-trend opportunity.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h NEUTRAL (price=1.115 ≈ EMA20=1.1149, RSI 47.6), 15m bullish (price=1.115 > EMA20=1.0966, RSI 62.3), 3m bullish (price=1.115 > EMA20=1.1063, RSI 65.7). Mixed signals but 15m+3m bullish. Existing LONG position at breakeven. No counter-trend SHORT opportunity.\n\n**ADA**: 1h bullish (price=0.4348 > EMA20=0.4206, RSI 67.4), 15m bullish (price=0.4348 > EMA20=0.4234, RSI 79.9), 3m bullish (price=0.4348 > EMA20=0.4312, RSI 72.8). All timeframes aligned bullish. Existing LONG position with small profit. No counter-trend opportunity.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13.49 > EMA20=13.0255, RSI 70.8), 15m bullish (price=13.49 > EMA20=13.1418, RSI 82.1), 3m bullish (price=13.49 > EMA20=13.3697, RSI 73.5). All timeframes aligned bullish. Volume extremely weak (0.04x). No counter-trend opportunity.\n\n**SOL**: 1h bullish (price=144.15 > EMA20=138.26, RSI 71.5), 15m bullish (price=144.15 > EMA20=139.23, RSI 81.7), 3m bullish (price=144.15 > EMA20=141.89, RSI 86.6). All timeframes strongly bullish. Volume weak (0.10x). No counter-trend opportunity.\n\n**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: LONG slots are FULL (0 available). All coins show 1h+15m+3m BULLISH alignment - no valid counter-trend SHORT opportunities exist. When all timeframes align bullish, counter-trend SHORT is invalid. Must HOLD existing positions and wait for better setups.\n\n**Existing Positions**: ADA LONG (small profit, thesis intact), ASTER LONG (breakeven, mixed signals but no reversal). Both positions should be held as no reversal signals are present (only informational 3m reversals which are normal noise).",

All timeframes aligned BULLISH. However, coin is in cooldown (1 cycle remaining) - NO TRADES ALLOWED. Market regime NEUTRAL suggests mixed signals despite bullish alignment.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4348 > EMA20=0.4206, RSI 67.4), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4348 > EMA20=0.4234, RSI 79.9), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4322 > EMA20=0.4315, RSI 58.9). EXISTING LONG POSITION. All timeframes remain bullish. Current position shows -0.71 PnL but thesis remains valid.

Strong bullish structure with 3m pullback. Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM alignment strength with 3 conditions met. Volume ratio 1.21x is above average, suggesting good participation.

Global regime strongly bullish (83% bullish count). Counter-trend opportunities exist for XRP, DOGE, LINK but require confidence ≥0.65. Given the strong bullish market structure and my excellent long performance history (83% win rate), I'll prioritize trend-following LONG entries where alignment is strongest.\n\n**DECISION RATIONALE**: SOL shows the strongest bullish alignment across all timeframes with good momentum. LINK offers a counter-trend SHORT opportunity but given the overwhelmingly bullish market context and my strong long performance, I'll focus on the high-probability trend-following setup in SOL. ADA position remains valid despite small drawdown.",

Market regime NEUTRAL but all timeframes show bullish momentum. Volume extremely weak (0.05x). No counter-trend opportunity.\n\n**ADA** (EXISTING LONG): 1h BULLISH (price=0.4348 > EMA20=0.4206, RSI 67.4), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4348 > EMA20=0.4234, RSI 79.9), 3m BULLISH (price=0.434 > EMA20=0.432, RSI 64.3). Position is profitable (+$0.14). All timeframes remain bullish with strong momentum. No reversal signals - only 3m shows minor reversal but strength \"NONE\".

No valid counter-trend SHORT opportunities exist (all coins show 15m+3m BULLISH, not BEARISH). According to rules: \"If you identify a valid counter-trend opportunity but cannot execute it due to limits, you MUST NOT open a trend-following trade in the opposite direction.\" Therefore, no new entries in either direction.\n\n**VOLUME WARNING**: Extremely weak volume across all coins (0.04-0.25x average) suggests low market participation and conviction. This reduces confidence in new entries and supports holding existing profitable positions.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis. Current market regime is strongly bullish (5/6 coins bullish), but position slots show LONG_FULL with 0 long slots available and 2 short slots available. This means I can only consider SHORT entries or manage existing LONG positions.\n\n**XRP**: 1h bullish (price=2.2464 > EMA20=2.1916, RSI 64.9), 15m bullish (price=2.2305 > EMA20=2.2050, RSI 65.8), 3m bearish (price=2.2305 < EMA20=2.2342, RSI 49.8). Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM alignment strength for SHORT with 3/5 conditions met, but volume ratio 0.67 is normal. However, 1h trend remains strongly bullish and counter-trend SHORT would require confidence ≥0.65. Given the strong bullish structure and only 3m showing weakness, I'll pass on counter-trend SHORT here.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h bullish (price=0.15648 > EMA20=0.1519, RSI 69.8), 15m bullish (price=0.15567 > EMA20=0.1534, RSI 70.8), 3m bullish (price=0.15567 > EMA20=0.1557, RSI 53.8). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.37 is weak. No counter-trade opportunity as all timeframes align bullish. No SHORT setup here.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h NEUTRAL regime (price=1.115 ≈ EMA20=1.1149, RSI 47.6), 15m bullish (price=1.109 > EMA20=1.0971, RSI 57.7), 3m bullish (price=1.109 > EMA20=1.1074, RSI 55.1). Volume ratio extremely weak at 0.18. NEUTRAL regime allows both directions, but weak volume and mixed signals don't provide strong SHORT edge.\n\n**ADA** (existing LONG): 1h bullish (price=0.4348 > EMA20=0.4206, RSI 67.4), 15m bullish (price=0.4329 > EMA20=0.4241, RSI 73.3), 3m bullish (price=0.4329 > EMA20=0.4319, RSI 58.9). Position is slightly down -$0.38 but all timeframes remain bullish. Reversal signals show only 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL) which is normal noise. Hold position as thesis remains valid.\n\n**LINK**: 1h bullish (price=13.49 > EMA20=13.0255, RSI 70.8), 15m bullish (price=13.39 > EMA20=13.1542, RSI 69.9), 3m bullish (price=13.39 > EMA20=13.3736, RSI 55.4). All timeframes aligned bullish with volume ratio extremely weak at 0.15.

All timeframes aligned bullish but volume is WEAK (0.34x avg), suggesting limited participation.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=144.15 > EMA20=138.26, RSI 71.5), 15m BULLISH (price=143.47 > EMA20=139.55, RSI 74.4), 3m BULLISH (price=144.31 > EMA20=142.63, RSI 71.3). All timeframes aligned bullish with NORMAL volume. Strongest setup with excellent volume confirmation.\n\n**Counter-trade Analysis**: All coins show BULLISH alignment across all timeframes (1h+15m+3m), so no valid counter-trend opportunities exist. All risk levels are VERY_HIGH_RISK for counter-trades, which reinforces the strong bullish trend.\n\n**Position Slot Analysis**: 1 long slot available, 2 short slots available. Given the strong bullish market regime and excellent long performance history, I should prioritize high-quality LONG setups.\n\n**Best Opportunities**: SOL and DOGE show the strongest bullish setups with normal volume confirmation across all timeframes. XRP is also strong but slightly less compelling than SOL. ASTER and LINK have weak volume, reducing confidence.",

Critical constraint: LONG slots are FULL (0 available), so only SHORT entries or HOLD decisions are possible. Must evaluate counter-trend opportunities carefully.\n\n**Market Context**: Global regime is strongly bullish (83% bullish count), but volume is universally weak across all coins (volume ratios 0.02-0.43x average), suggesting low conviction in the bullish move.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2464 > EMA20=2.1916, RSI 64.9), 15m BULLISH (price=2.2305 > EMA20=2.2050, RSI 65.8), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2394 > EMA20=2.2357, RSI 55.7). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume extremely weak (0.43x). No counter-trend opportunity since all timeframes aligned same direction.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.15648 > EMA20=0.1519, RSI 69.8), 15m BULLISH (price=0.15567 > EMA20=0.1534, RSI 70.8), 3m BULLISH (price=0.15636 > EMA20=0.1558, RSI 60.6). All timeframes bullish with existing LONG position. Volume extremely weak (0.02x). Position showing small profit, continue holding.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BULLISH (price=1.115 > EMA20=1.1149, RSI 47.6), 15m BULLISH (price=1.109 > EMA20=1.0971, RSI 57.7), 3m BULLISH (price=1.11 > EMA20=1.1083, RSI 55.7). All timeframes bullish but 1h RSI relatively weak at 47.6. Volume extremely weak (0.04x). No counter-trend setup.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4348 > EMA20=0.4206, RSI 67.4), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4329 > EMA20=0.4241, RSI 73.3), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4341 > EMA20=0.4325, RSI 62.0). All timeframes bullish with existing LONG position. Position showing profit, continue holding.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=13.49 > EMA20=13.0255, RSI 70.8), 15m BULLISH (price=13.39 > EMA20=13.1542, RSI 69.9), 3m BULLISH (price=13.45 > EMA20=13.3940, RSI 60.7). All timeframes bullish. Volume weak (0.19x). No counter-trend opportunity.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=144.15 > EMA20=138.26, RSI 71.5), 15m BULLISH (price=143.47 > EMA20=139.55, RSI 74.4), 3m BULLISH (price=144.18 > EMA20=142.91, RSI 70.3). All timeframes strongly bullish with RSI approaching overbought. Volume extremely weak (0.03x). No counter-trend setup.\n\n**Critical Assessment**: All coins show aligned bullish momentum across all timeframes with NO counter-trend opportunities (15m+3m not opposing 1h). With LONG slots full and no valid counter-trend SHORT setups, must HOLD existing positions and wait for better opportunities. Volume weakness across all coins suggests the bullish move lacks conviction, but technical structure remains intact.",
