Position slots: short slots full (2 used), long slots available (2). Constraint: short slots full, so no new short entries allowed; long entries only if low or medium risk with high confidence. Counter-trade analysis is empty, so no explicit counter-trend signals. Trend reversal data shows no reversals for XRP, DOGE, ASTER, ADA; LINK has 3m reversal with medium strength and medium loss risk; SOL has 3m reversal with informational strength and low loss risk. Volume is weak across all coins (ratio <=0.5x), reducing confidence per rules. Cooldowns inactive. Analyze each coin:\n\nXRP: 1h bearish (price=2.0588 < EMA20=2.1041, RSI=31.37), 15m bearish (price=2.0477 < EMA20=2.0508, RSI=43.68), 3m bearish (price=2.0477 < EMA20=2.05, RSI=44.65). All timeframes aligned bearish, but short slots full, so cannot open new short. Existing short position with unrealized PnL -0.00971; no reversal signals, hold. Volume ratio 0.19x (weak), do not trade new.\n\nDOGE: 1h bearish (price=0.13828 < EMA20=0.1420, RSI=26.15), 15m bearish (price=0.13726 < EMA20=0.13775, RSI=37.86), 3m bearish (price=0.13727 < EMA20=0.13753, RSI=40.97). All bearish, but short slots full, so no new short. No position, volume ratio 0.21x (weak), hold.\n\nASTER: 1h bearish (price=1.002 < EMA20=1.0248, RSI=33.14), 15m bearish (price=0.997 < EMA20=1.0006, RSI=43.63), 3m bearish (price=0.997 < EMA20=0.9975, RSI=47.88). All bearish, but short slots full, so no new short. Existing short position with unrealized PnL -0.1825; no reversal signals, hold. Volume ratio 0.09x (very weak), do not trade new.\n\nADA: 1h bearish (price=0.3881 < EMA20=0.3997, RSI=28.72), 15m bearish (price=0.386 < EMA20=0.3870, RSI=42.12), 3m bearish (price=0.386 < EMA20=0.3865, RSI=44.71). All bearish, but short slots full, so no new short. No position, volume ratio 0.17x (weak), hold.\n\nLINK: 1h bearish (price=12.19 < EMA20=12.5482, RSI=27.28), 15m bearish (price=12.17 < EMA20=12.1861, RSI=42.86), 3m bullish (price=12.17 > EMA20=12.1586, RSI=52.45). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish with reversal signal (medium strength). This could be a counter-trend long opportunity. Risk level: 3m reversal with medium strength, but volume ratio 0.33x (weak) and no strong confluence; confidence low. Since short slots full, cannot open short; long possible but requires low/medium risk with high confidence. Here, confidence reduced due to weak volume and mixed alignment, so hold.\n\nSOL: 1h bearish (price=127.78 < EMA20=130.8762, RSI=30.07), 15m bearish (price=127.43 < EMA20=127.3396, RSI=46.45), 3m bullish (price=127.43 > EMA20=127.3397, RSI=53.03). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish with reversal signal (informational strength). Market regime neutral. Could be counter-trend long, but volume ratio 0.23x (weak) and no strong alignment. Risk level low due to informational reversal, but confidence low. Since short slots full, cannot open short; long possible but not justified by weak signals, hold.\n\nOverall, no new entries due to short slots full, weak volume across all coins, and no high-confidence long setups.

Invalidation condition: if 1h price closes above EMA20 (2.1041).\n\nDOGE: 1h bearish (price=0.13828 < EMA20=0.1420, RSI=26.15), 15m bearish (price=0.13726 < EMA20=0.1377, RSI=37.86), 3m bearish (price=0.13727 < EMA20=0.1375, RSI=42.40). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.29x (weak). No position. Short slots full, so cannot open short. No counter-trend signal (3m trend bearish). Hold.\n\nASTER: 1h bearish (price=1.002 < EMA20=1.0248, RSI=33.14), 15m bearish (price=0.997 < EMA20=1.0006, RSI=43.63), 3m bullish (price=0.998 > EMA20=0.9976, RSI=50.20). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.24x (weak). Existing short position with unrealized PnL -0.24. Reversal signals: 3m reversal true with strength MEDIUM, loss_risk_signal MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. According to exit logic, reversal applies to existing positions; 3m reversal against short position (since 3m bullish) with strength MEDIUM suggests consider closing if PnL negative. PnL is negative (-0.24), so close position. Invalidation condition: if 1h price closes above EMA20 (1.0248).\n\nADA: 1h bearish (price=0.3881 < EMA20=0.3997, RSI=28.72), 15m bearish (price=0.386 < EMA20=0.3870, RSI=42.12), 3m bearish (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.3864, RSI=43.84). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.43x (weak). No position. Short slots full, so cannot open short. No counter-trend signal. Hold.\n\nLINK: 1h bearish (price=12.19 < EMA20=12.5482, RSI=27.28), 15m bearish (price=12.17 < EMA20=12.1861, RSI=42.86), 3m bullish (price=12.16 > EMA20=12.1589, RSI=49.85). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.20x (weak, caution: volume ratio <=0.20x is hard rule to not trade). No position. Short slots full, so cannot open short. Counter-trend potential: 3m bullish vs 1h bearish, but risk_level from trend reversal data is MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. According to counter-trend rules, MEDIUM_RISK requires confidence >0.65 to execute. Volume weak reduces confidence. No trade.\n\nSOL: 1h bearish (price=127.78 < EMA20=130.8762, RSI=30.07), 15m bearish (price=127.43 < EMA20=127.3396, RSI=46.45), 3m bearish (price=127.23 < EMA20=127.3184, RSI=47.58). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.78x (normal). No position. Short slots full, so cannot open short. No counter-trend signal. Hold.\n\nOverall, close ASTER short due to reversal signal and negative PnL. All other coins: hold. No new entries due to slot constraints or weak signals.",

TREND REVERSAL shows 3m reversal MEDIUM strength against my SHORT position. Volume ratio=0.25x (WEAK). 1h trend remains bearish but 3m shows bullish momentum. According to reversal rules: MEDIUM strength (only 3m reversal) means continue monitoring, don't overreact to noise. My position is already at -0.54% PnL, close to the 3% HARD MARGIN STOP LOSS.

Invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20 (2.1041).\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13723 < EMA20=0.1414, RSI=23.84), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13724 < EMA20=0.1377, RSI=39.20), 3m BEARISH (price=0.13724 < EMA20=0.1373, RSI=45.06). All three timeframes aligned bearish with volume ratio=0.56 (NORMAL). Open Interest high, funding negative. No position. SHORT slots available=0 (full), so cannot open new SHORT. LONG slots available=2, but trend is bearish; counter-trade analysis empty, so no valid LONG setup. Hold.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1 < EMA20=1.0222, RSI=32.86), 15m BEARISH (price=1 < EMA20=1.0006, RSI=46.75), 3m BULLISH (price=1 > EMA20=0.9977, RSI=55.72). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.38 (WEAK), funding slightly positive. Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL=-0.6574. Reversal signal: 3m_reversal=true (strength=MEDIUM), loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. According to exit_logic, 3m reversal alone is MEDIUM strength; do not overreact, but monitor. Since PnL is negative and risk is medium, consider closing if thesis invalidated. Invalidation condition: 1h price closes above EMA20 (1.0248). Current price=1, not invalidated. Hold but watch closely.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.3981, RSI=27.45), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.3868, RSI=42.86), 3m BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.3860, RSI=47.54). All three timeframes aligned bearish with volume ratio=0.71 (NORMAL). Open Interest moderate, funding negative. No position. SHORT slots available=0 (full), so cannot open new SHORT. LONG slots available=2, but trend is bearish; counter-trade analysis empty, so no valid LONG setup. Hold.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.16 < EMA20=12.5078, RSI=25.74), 15m BEARISH (price=12.16 < EMA20=12.1805, RSI=42.32), 3m BULLISH (price=12.16 > EMA20=12.1560, RSI=50.72). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.12 (WEAK, <=0.20x average), funding negative. According to volume_rules, if volume ratio <=0.20x, DO NOT TRADE (hard rule). No position. Reversal signal: 3m_reversal=true (strength=MEDIUM), loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. But volume too low to trade. Hold.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=127.17 < EMA20=130.4578, RSI=28.92), 15m BEARISH (price=127.17 < EMA20=127.2905, RSI=43.86), 3m BEARISH (price=127.18 < EMA20=127.1994, RSI=48.78). All three timeframes aligned bearish with volume ratio=0.59 (NORMAL). Open Interest moderate, funding negative. No position. SHORT slots available=0 (full), so cannot open new SHORT. LONG slots available=2, but trend is bearish; counter-trade analysis empty, so no valid LONG setup. Hold.\n\nOverall: Market regime is bearish (global_regime=bearish). Position slots: SHORT full (2 used), LONG available (2 slots). Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE, do not force LONG trades unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. Counter-trade analysis is empty, so no valid counter-trend opportunities. All coins show bearish or mixed signals; no high-confidence LONG setups. Maintain discipline: hold existing positions, avoid new entries due to slot constraints and lack of clear edge.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish with all coins in BEARISH market regime. Position slots: 2 short positions open (XRP and ASTER), short slots full (0 available), long slots available (2). Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE, so do NOT force LONG trades unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence. Counter-trade analysis is empty, no explicit counter-trend signals. Trend reversal data shows 3m reversals for DOGE, ASTER, ADA, LINK, SOL with MEDIUM strength, but these are informational for existing positions; for entries, prioritize alignment. Volume is weak for most coins (ratio <0.5x), reducing confidence. Cooldowns: none active. Risk: short performance negative, but no cooldown. Analysis per coin:\n\nXRP: Has short position with unrealized PnL +0.4836. 1h BEARISH (price=2.0473 < EMA20=2.0976, RSI=29.36), 15m BEARISH (price=2.0472 < EMA20=2.0505, RSI=44.25), 3m BEARISH (price=2.0438 < EMA20=2.0484, RSI=38.47). All timeframes aligned bearish, volume normal. No reversal signals. Hold position, adjust exit plan if needed.\n\nDOGE: No position. 1h BEARISH (price=0.13723 < EMA20=0.1414, RSI=23.84), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13724 < EMA20=0.13766, RSI=39.20), 3m BULLISH (price=0.13743 > EMA20=0.13737, RSI=50.97). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume weak (ratio=0.058). Trend-following SHORT not possible due to short slots full. Counter-trend LONG: 3m bullish, but risk_level not provided in counter_trade_analysis; assume MEDIUM_RISK if forced. Confidence low due to volume and mixed alignment. Hold.\n\nASTER: Has short position with unrealized PnL -0.5536. 1h BEARISH (price=1 < EMA20=1.0222, RSI=32.86), 15m BEARISH (price=1 < EMA20=1.0006, RSI=46.75), 3m BULLISH (price=0.999 < EMA20=0.9981, RSI=52.41). Mixed: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume weak. Reversal signal: 3m reversal MEDIUM against short position. Consider closing if PnL negative, but reversal strength MEDIUM (only 3m). Monitor; hold for now as 1h trend still bearish.\n\nADA: No position. 1h BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.3981, RSI=27.45), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.3868, RSI=42.86), 3m BULLISH (price=0.3865 > EMA20=0.3862, RSI=52.67). Similar to DOGE: mixed signals, volume weak. Trend-following SHORT not possible. Counter-trend LONG: 3m bullish, but risk unknown. Hold.\n\nLINK: No position. 1h BEARISH (price=12.16 < EMA20=12.5078, RSI=25.74), 15m BEARISH (price=12.16 < EMA20=12.1805, RSI=42.32), 3m BULLISH (price=12.17 > EMA20=12.1629, RSI=52.13). Mixed, volume weak. Hold.\n\nSOL: No position. 1h BEARISH (price=127.17 < EMA20=130.4578, RSI=28.92), 15m BEARISH (price=127.17 < EMA20=127.2905, RSI=43.86), 3m BULLISH (price=127.45 > EMA20=127.2688, RSI=55.52). Mixed, volume weak. Hold.\n\nOverall: Short slots full, so no new SHORT entries. LONG opportunities exist but mixed signals and weak volume reduce confidence below 0.4 min threshold. Discipline: hold cash when no clear edge. Existing positions: hold XRP, monitor ASTER.",

All timeframes aligned bearish with strong volume (ratio=1.61). Open Interest high, funding negative. Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL +0.7722. No reversal signals (strength=NONE). Continue holding SHORT. Invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20 (2.1041).\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13723 < EMA20=0.1414, RSI=23.84), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13742 < EMA20=0.1377, RSI=41.71), 3m BULLISH (price=0.13743 > EMA20=0.1374, RSI=50.97). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume weak (ratio=0.17). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM, loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Counter-trade analysis empty, but 3m bullish suggests potential counter-trend LONG. However, short_slots_available=0 (SHORT_FULL), so cannot open SHORT. Counter-trend LONG would be OPPOSITE to 1h trend (bearish), but risk_level not provided; based on reversal strength=MEDIUM and volume weak, confidence low. Also, constraint_instruction: if direction full, do not force trades in other direction unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. Here, LONG setup is weak (mixed timeframes, low volume), so HOLD.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1 < EMA20=1.0222, RSI=32.86), 15m BEARISH (price=0.999 < EMA20=1.0005, RSI=45.64), 3m BULLISH (price=0.999 > EMA20=0.9983, RSI=52.21).

TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM, loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Reversal against SHORT position (3m bullish) suggests consider closing if PnL negative, but exit_logic: only close if strong reversal (15m+3m both against). Here, only 3m reversal (MEDIUM strength), so continue monitoring. Invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20 (1.0248). HOLD SHORT.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.3981, RSI=27.45), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3865 < EMA20=0.3869, RSI=44.91), 3m BULLISH (price=0.3865 > EMA20=0.3862, RSI=52.64). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume weak (ratio=0.15). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM, loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Counter-trend LONG opportunity (opposite to 1h bearish), but risk_level not provided; based on reversal strength=MEDIUM and volume weak, confidence low. short_slots_available=0, so cannot open SHORT. LONG setup weak, so HOLD.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.16 < EMA20=12.5078, RSI=25.74), 15m BEARISH (price=12.18 < EMA20=12.1824, RSI=44.98), 3m BULLISH (price=12.18 > EMA20=12.1654, RSI=55.09).

Counter-trend LONG opportunity, but risk_level not provided; volume ratio <=0.20x average is a hard rule: DO NOT TRADE. Here, volume_ratio=0.082, so skip. HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h NEUTRAL? market_regime=NEUTRAL, but htf indicators: price=127.17 < EMA20=130.46, RSI=28.92, so technically bearish. 15m BEARISH (price=127.34 < EMA20=127.3067, RSI=46.26), 3m BULLISH (price=127.34 > EMA20=127.267, RSI=52.26).

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish with all 6 coins in BEARISH market regime. Position slots: 1 short position open (XRP), with 3 available slots (2 long, 1 short). No cooldowns active. Short performance has negative net PnL but profitability index of 19, indicating some edge. Volume ratios are weak for most coins (<=0.50x), reducing confidence. Counter-trade analysis is empty, so no counter-trend opportunities identified. Trend reversal data shows some 3m reversals but mostly informational or medium strength; for existing positions, only consider closing if strong reversal against position (15m+3m both reversal), which is not present. Analyze each coin:\n\nXRP: Has existing short position. 1h bearish (price=2.0473 < EMA20=2.0976, RSI=29.36 oversold), 15m bearish (price=2.0399 < EMA20=2.0487, RSI=40.46), 3m bearish (price=2.0406 < EMA20=2.0448, RSI=38.95). All timeframes aligned bearish, supporting current short. Volume ratio=0.17x (WEAK), but trend strong. No reversal signals against short. Hold position; consider closing only if 1h price closes above EMA20 (invalidation condition).\n\nDOGE: 1h bearish (price=0.13723 < EMA20=0.14143, RSI=23.84 oversold), 15m bearish (price=0.13746 < EMA20=0.13765, RSI=42.34), 3m neutral (price=0.1373 ≈ EMA20=0.13737, RSI=46.60). 3m shows slight bullish momentum but not strong. Volume ratio=0.29x (WEAK). No strong alignment for entry; trend-following short possible but weak volume reduces confidence. Hold.\n\nASTER: 1h bearish (price=1.00 < EMA20=1.0222, RSI=32.86), 15m bearish (price=0.999 < EMA20=1.0003, RSI=45.64), 3m bullish (price=1.002 > EMA20=0.9988, RSI=59.83). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.52x (NORMAL). Counter-trend analysis not provided, but based on reversal data: risk_level=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK, 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM. According to strategy, counter-trend trades require confidence >0.65 and risk_level not HIGH_RISK or VERY_HIGH_RISK. Here, risk_level is MEDIUM_RISK, so valid if confidence >0.65. However, 3m bullish but volume normal, not strong confluence. Confidence estimated 0.55, below threshold. Hold.\n\nADA: 1h bearish (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.39815, RSI=27.45 oversold), 15m bearish (price=0.3863 < EMA20=0.38676, RSI=44.29), 3m neutral (price=0.3862 ≈ EMA20=0.38622, RSI=49.37). All timeframes bearish or neutral, no strong bullish signals. Volume ratio=0.36x (WEAK). No clear edge. Hold.\n\nLINK: 1h bearish (price=12.16 < EMA20=12.5078, RSI=25.74 oversold), 15m bearish (price=12.18 < EMA20=12.1813, RSI=45.08), 3m bullish (price=12.18 > EMA20=12.1704, RSI=53.92). Mixed signals similar to ASTER. Volume ratio=0.40x (WEAK). Reversal data: risk_level=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK, 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM. Counter-trend long possible but confidence low due to weak volume and mixed alignment. Hold.\n\nSOL: 1h bearish (price=127.17 < EMA20=130.4578, RSI=28.92 oversold), 15m bearish (price=127.26 < EMA20=127.2936, RSI=45.18), 3m bullish (price=127.35 > EMA20=127.2656, RSI=52.99). Mixed signals. Volume ratio=0.34x (WEAK). Reversal data: risk_level=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK, 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM. Counter-trend long possible but confidence low. Hold.\n\nOverall, no high-confidence setups due to weak volume and mixed signals. Best to hold existing position and avoid new entries.",

All timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume. No reversal signals detected (strength=NONE). Position is profitable; continue holding with existing exit plan. Invalidation condition remains: If 1h price closes above 1h EMA20 (2.1041).\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13723 < EMA20=0.14143, RSI=23.84), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13727 < EMA20=0.13763, RSI=40.03), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.13727 ≈ EMA20=0.13736, RSI=45.61). 3m shows slight bullish divergence but not strong enough for counter-trend.

HOLD.\n\nSOL: Market regime NEUTRAL. 1h BEARISH (price=127.17 < EMA20=130.4578, RSI=28.92), 15m NEUTRAL (price=127.4 ≈ EMA20=127.3069, RSI=47.22), 3m BULLISH (price=127.39 > EMA20=127.2775, RSI=54.27). Mixed signals with 3m bullish divergence. Counter-trade analysis shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM with loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Volume is WEAK (ratio=0.4967), which reduces confidence significantly per volume rules. Do NOT trade due to weak volume. HOLD.\n\nPosition Slots: 1 open position (XRP SHORT). Short slots available=1, long slots available=2. No cooldowns active. Global regime bearish. No exceptional setups identified; discipline dictates holding cash when no clear edge exists.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish with 6 bearish coins, 0 bullish, 0 neutral. Position slots: total open 1 (XRP short), max positions 4, long slots available 2, short slots available 1. Constraints: same direction limit 2, do not force trades if direction full. Counter-trade analysis empty. Cooldowns: none active. Risk: short performance negative but profitability index high, caution on consecutive losses. Volume rules: avoid trades if volume ratio <=0.20x. Reversal signals: monitor for exits on existing positions.\n\nXRP: Has existing short position. 1h bearish (price=2.0473 < EMA20=2.0976, RSI=29.36), 15m bearish (price=2.0408 < EMA20=2.0481, RSI=41.17), 3m bearish (price=2.0409 < EMA20=2.0439, RSI=40.53). All timeframes aligned bearish, supporting current short. Volume ratio 0.146 (WEAK, <0.20x), but position already open; reversal signals show NONE, so hold. Invalidation condition: 1h price closes above EMA20 (2.1041). PnL positive at 0.40673, no need to close.\n\nDOGE: 1h bearish (price=0.13723 < EMA20=0.1414, RSI=23.84), 15m bearish (price=0.13723 < EMA20=0.1376, RSI=39.63), 3m neutral (price=0.13723 ≈ EMA20=0.1373, RSI=44.62). 1h and 15m bearish, 3m neutral. Volume ratio 0.410 (WEAK but >0.20x). Reversal signal: 3m reversal true, strength INFORMATIONAL, loss risk LOW_LOSS_RISK. For counter-trend: risk_level not provided, but 3m reversal suggests potential LONG counter-trend. However, 1h and 15m bearish, so counter-trend direction would be LONG (opposite to 1h). Confidence low due to weak volume and only 3m signal. Risk level likely MEDIUM_RISK or HIGH_RISK. Since slots: short slots available 1, long slots available 2. But counter-trade analysis empty, so no explicit risk_level. Given weak signals and volume, skip.\n\nASTER: Market regime NEUTRAL. 1h bearish (price=1.00 < EMA20=1.0222, RSI=32.86), 15m neutral (price=1.001 ≈ EMA20=1.0006, RSI=47.96), 3m bullish (price=1.001 > EMA20=0.9995, RSI=55.47). Mixed signals: 1h bearish, 15m neutral, 3m bullish. Volume ratio 0.094 (WEAK, <0.20x) – hard rule: DO NOT TRADE. Reversal signal: 3m reversal true, strength MEDIUM, loss risk MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Counter-trend potential: 3m bullish suggests LONG counter-trend, but volume too low. Skip.\n\nADA: 1h bearish (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.3981, RSI=27.45), 15m bearish (price=0.386 < EMA20=0.3867, RSI=43.27), 3m neutral (price=0.386 ≈ EMA20=0.3862, RSI=47.16). 1h and 15m bearish, 3m neutral. Volume ratio 0.578 (NORMAL). Reversal signal: 3m reversal true, strength INFORMATIONAL, loss risk LOW_LOSS_RISK. Counter-trend potential: 3m reversal suggests LONG, but signals weak. Risk level likely MEDIUM_RISK. Slots available for LONG. However, confidence low due to only 3m signal and 1h/15m bearish. Skip.\n\nLINK: Market regime NEUTRAL. 1h bearish (price=12.16 < EMA20=12.5078, RSI=25.74), 15m neutral (price=12.19 ≈ EMA20=12.1822, RSI=46.51), 3m bullish (price=12.19 > EMA20=12.1763, RSI=55.75). Mixed signals: 1h bearish, 15m neutral, 3m bullish. Volume ratio 0.982 (NORMAL). Reversal signal: 3m reversal true, strength MEDIUM, loss risk MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Counter-trend potential: 3m bullish suggests LONG counter-trend. Risk level from reversal: MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK corresponds to MEDIUM_RISK in playbook. For counter-trend, need confidence >0.65. Here, 3m alignment with strong volume/RSI? RSI 55.75 moderate, volume normal. But 1h bearish, 15m neutral – not strong confluence. Confidence estimated 0.5-0.6, below threshold. Skip.\n\nSOL: 1h bearish (price=127.17 < EMA20=130.4578, RSI=28.92), 15m bearish (price=127.3 < EMA20=127.3046, RSI=45.88), 3m neutral (price=127.3 ≈ EMA20=127.2937, RSI=50.48). 1h and 15m bearish, 3m neutral. Volume ratio 0.202 (WEAK but >0.20x). Reversal signal: 3m reversal true, strength MEDIUM, loss risk MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Counter-trend potential: 3m reversal suggests LONG, but signals weak. Risk level likely MEDIUM_RISK. Slots available for LONG. Confidence low due to weak volume and only 3m signal. Skip.\n\nOverall, no new high-confidence setups. Hold existing XRP short.

TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal=TRUE but strength=INFORMATIONAL (only 3m reversal against SHORT position). Since 1h and 15m remain bearish, this is noise. Continue holding SHORT. Invalidation if 1h price closes above 1h EMA20 (2.1041).\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13723 < EMA20=0.1414, RSI=23.84), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13723 < EMA20=0.1376, RSI=39.63), 3m BEARISH (price=0.13721 < EMA20=0.1373, RSI=44.02).

Continue holding SHORT. Invalidation if 1h price closes above 1h EMA20 (0.1414).\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.0 < EMA20=1.0222, RSI=32.86), 15m NEUTRAL (price=1.001 ≈ EMA20=1.0006, RSI=47.96), 3m BULLISH (price=1.003 > EMA20=1.0002, RSI=61.29). Mixed signals: 1h bearish but 3m bullish with volume ratio=0.69x (NORMAL). Existing LONG position with unrealized PnL=-0.0564. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows htf_reversal=TRUE (1h reversal against LONG position) and 3m_reversal=TRUE with strength=MEDIUM. This indicates momentum moving AGAINST LONG position. According to exit_logic, consider closing if PnL negative and thesis invalidated. Current PnL is negative (-0.0564), and reversal signals suggest weakening LONG thesis. Close LONG position.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.3981, RSI=27.45), 15m BEARISH (price=0.386 < EMA20=0.3867, RSI=43.27), 3m BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.3861, RSI=45.72). All three timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.38x (WEAK) - below 0.50x threshold, reducing confidence significantly. No position. According to volume_rules, low volume caution applies. Do not trade due to weak volume.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.16 < EMA20=12.5078, RSI=25.74), 15m BEARISH (price=12.19 < EMA20=12.1822, RSI=46.51), 3m NEUTRAL (price=12.17 ≈ EMA20=12.1752, RSI=48.90). Mixed signals with 1h and 15m bearish, 3m neutral. Volume ratio=0.08x (WEAK) - below 0.20x threshold. According to volume_rules, DO NOT TRADE if volume ratio <= 0.20x. This is a hard rule.

DIRECTIONAL_BIAS shows short profitability_index=19.0 (positive), but short net_pnl=-1.22 (negative). COOLDOWN_STATUS: no cooldowns active.\n\nDecision: Close ASTER LONG due to negative PnL and reversal signals. Hold XRP and DOGE SHORTs as trends remain bearish.

Current confidence based on data: 3m bullish with RSI=56.61, MACD positive, but volume ratio=0.215 (WEAK, <0.50x average) reduces confidence. Estimated confidence ~0.60 (<0.65), so do NOT trade.

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=2.0473 < EMA20=2.0976, RSI=29.36), 15m BEARISH (price=2.0415 < EMA20=2.0474, RSI=41.80), 3m BEARISH (price=2.0426 < EMA20=2.0435, RSI=45.88). All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (ratio=0.30x). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL against short position, but strength is low; current trend 3m is BEARISH, so reversal is minor. Position is short with unrealized PnL positive; no strong exit signal. Continue holding with invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20 (2.1041).\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13723 < EMA20=0.1414, RSI=23.84), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13714 < EMA20=0.1375, RSI=38.69), 3m BEARISH (price=0.13714 < EMA20=0.1373, RSI=41.60). All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (ratio=0.35x). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows no reversal signals. Position is short with unrealized PnL positive; no strong exit signal.

Timeframes conflict: 1h bearish, 3m bullish, 15m neutral. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal MEDIUM with risk MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK; current trend 3m is BULLISH, indicating potential counter-trend LONG opportunity. However, volume is weak (ratio=0.23x), reducing confidence. POSITION_SLOTS has short_slots_available=0, so cannot open SHORT; but counter-trend LONG is valid. Check constraints: risk_level from COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS is not provided, but reversal strength MEDIUM suggests MEDIUM_RISK. According to strategy, MEDIUM_RISK requires confidence >0.65; current analysis shows mixed signals and low volume, so confidence is below 0.65. Also, POSITION_SLOTS constraint_instruction says if a direction is FULL (SHORT full), do NOT force trades in other direction unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence. Here, confidence is low, so HOLD.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.3981, RSI=27.45), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.3866, RSI=42.95), 3m BEARISH (price=0.386 < EMA20=0.3861, RSI=47.44). All timeframes aligned bearish with very weak volume (ratio=0.14x). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL, but strength low. Volume ratio <=0.20x, so DO NOT TRADE per volume rules. HOLD.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.16 < EMA20=12.5078, RSI=25.74), 15m BEARISH (price=12.18 < EMA20=12.182, RSI=45.24), 3m BULLISH (price=12.19 > EMA20=12.1805, RSI=55.50). Timeframes conflict: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal MEDIUM with risk MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK; current trend 3m is BULLISH, indicating potential counter-trend LONG opportunity. Volume is very weak (ratio=0.037x), which is <=0.20x, so DO NOT TRADE per volume rules. HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=127.17 < EMA20=130.46, RSI=28.92), 15m BEARISH (price=127.23 < EMA20=127.29, RSI=44.97), 3m BEARISH (price=127.1 < EMA20=127.28, RSI=42.46). All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (ratio=0.21x). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows no reversal signals. POSITION_SLOTS has short_slots_available=0, so cannot open SHORT. No counter-trend signal, so HOLD.\n\nOverall, market regime is bearish with 6 bearish coins. Two short positions (XRP, DOGE) are active and performing well; no exits needed. Other coins have weak signals or volume issues. No new entries due to slot constraints or low confidence.",

Mixed signals: 1h bearish, 3m bullish, 15m neutral. Volume weak (ratio=0.085). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal=TRUE with strength=INFORMATIONAL and current_trend_3m=BULLISH. This suggests a counter-trend LONG opportunity (3m bullish against 1h bearish). However, volume ratio=0.085 is below 0.20x average, triggering weakness_warning: DO NOT TRADE. Also, POSITION_SLOTS shows short_slots_available=0, long_slots_available=2. But due to low volume, skip trade.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.3981, RSI=27.5), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.3866, RSI=42.9), 3m BEARISH (price=0.3857 < EMA20=0.3860, RSI=43.8). All three timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (ratio=0.232). No position. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows no reversal signals. Potential SHORT setup. But POSITION_SLOTS shows short_slots_available=0 (short direction full). According to constraint_instruction: If a direction is FULL, do NOT force trades in the other direction unless they are LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. This is a trend-following SHORT (not counter-trend), so cannot open due to slots full. Hold.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.2 < EMA20=12.5116, RSI=28.6), 15m BEARISH (price=12.18 < EMA20=12.1820, RSI=45.2), 3m BULLISH (price=12.21 > EMA20=12.1856, RSI=61.2). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume weak (ratio=0.113). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal=TRUE with strength=MEDIUM and current_trend_3m=BULLISH. This indicates a counter-trend LONG opportunity (3m bullish against 1h bearish). Risk_level from reversal_signals is MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. According to counter_trend rules, MEDIUM_RISK is VALID SIGNAL (Tier 2) and requires confidence > 0.65. However, volume ratio=0.113 is below 0.20x average, triggering weakness_warning: DO NOT TRADE. Also, POSITION_SLOTS shows short_slots_available=0, long_slots_available=2. But due to low volume, skip trade.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=127.11 < EMA20=130.452, RSI=28.5), 15m BEARISH (price=127.23 < EMA20=127.2932, RSI=45.0), 3m BEARISH (price=127.11 < EMA20=127.2301, RSI=44.0). All three timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (ratio=0.385). No position. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows no reversal signals. Potential SHORT setup. But POSITION_SLOTS shows short_slots_available=0 (short direction full). According to constraint_instruction: If a direction is FULL, do NOT force trades in the other direction unless they are LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. This is a trend-following SHORT (not counter-trend), so cannot open due to slots full. Hold.\n\nOverall: Market regime is bearish (global_regime=bearish). POSITION_SLOTS: short_slots_used=2 (full), long_slots_available=2. No cooldowns active. Volume is weak across all coins (ratios < 0.50x), reducing confidence. For existing positions (XRP, DOGE), hold as trends remain bearish. For others, no valid entries due to slot constraints or low volume.",

Mixed signals: 1h+15m bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.65x (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal=MEDIUM strength. This is a counter-trend LONG opportunity (3m bullish vs 1h bearish). Risk_level from reversal data: MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. According to counter-trend rules, MEDIUM_RISK requires confidence >0.65. Current confidence insufficient. POSITION_SLOTS: short_slots_available=0 (FULL), long_slots_available=2.

Mixed: 1h+15m bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.55x (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal=MEDIUM strength, loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. This indicates potential reversal against SHORT position. According to exit_logic: reversal_warning applies to existing positions. STRONG signal requires 15m+3m BOTH show reversal against position. Here, only 3m shows reversal (15m still bearish), so strength=MEDIUM. Action: Consider closing ONLY if PnL negative or thesis invalidated. PnL is negative (-0.459). Invalidation condition: If 1h price closes above 1h EMA20 (0.14104). Current 1h price=0.13731 < 0.14104, thesis still valid. However, with negative PnL and 3m reversal, consider closing to manage risk. Confidence low (0).

Mixed: 1h+15m bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.48x (WEAK). Volume rules: low_volume_caution (0.20-0.50x) reduces confidence significantly. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal=INFORMATIONAL strength, loss_risk_signal=LOW_LOSS_RISK. This is a counter-trend LONG opportunity. Risk_level=LOW_RISK. According to counter-trend rules, LOW_RISK is STRONG SIGNAL (Tier 1) if 15m+3m alignment + High Confluence. Here, 15m is bearish, not aligned with 3m bullish, so confluence low. Confidence reduced due to weak volume. POSITION_SLOTS: short_slots_available=0, long_slots_available=2. Constraint allows LOW_RISK trades. But setup weak: no 15m alignment, volume weak.

Mixed: 1h+15m bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio=1.17x (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal=MEDIUM strength, loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. This is a counter-trend LONG opportunity.

Global regime is bearish with all coins in BEARISH market regime, supporting trend-following SHORT setups. Position slots: 1 short position open (ADA), with 1 short slot available and 2 long slots available. No cooldowns active. Volume is weak for most coins (ratio <=0.50x), reducing confidence. Counter-trade analysis is empty, indicating no strong counter-trend opportunities. Trend reversal data shows XRP and SOL have 3m reversals (strength MEDIUM) but 1h bearish, suggesting potential counter-trend LONG setups; however, risk levels are MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK, and volume is weak, so confidence is low. For existing ADA short, reversal signals are NONE, and position is profitable; hold with invalidation condition monitored.\n\nXRP: 1h bearish (price=2.044 < EMA20=2.092, RSI=29.03), 15m bearish (price=2.0436 < EMA20=2.0464, RSI=44.47), 3m bullish (price=2.0435 > EMA20=2.0417, RSI=52.95) with volume ratio=0.41 (WEAK). 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM) but 1h and 15m bearish; counter-trend LONG possible but risk_level=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK and volume weak, so confidence low (<0.65). No clear edge; hold.\n\nDOGE: 1h bearish (price=0.13731 < EMA20=0.14104, RSI=24.39), 15m bearish (price=0.13695 < EMA20=0.13743, RSI=38.65), 3m bearish (price=0.13695 < EMA20=0.13704, RSI=42.61) with volume ratio=0.40 (WEAK). All timeframes aligned bearish, but volume weak reduces confidence. Trend-following SHORT setup, but short slots available=1. However, volume weakness suggests caution; confidence below 0.4 min threshold. Hold.\n\nASTER: 1h bearish (price=1.002 < EMA20=1.0204, RSI=34.28), 15m bearish (price=0.991 < EMA20=0.9989, RSI=38.26), 3m bearish (price=0.991 < EMA20=0.9954, RSI=39.30) with volume ratio=0.59 (NORMAL). All timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume, but RSI not oversold. Trend-following SHORT setup; short slots available=1. Confidence moderate due to alignment but RSI above 30. Target below support, stop above EMA20.\n\nADA: Existing short position. 1h bearish (price=0.3861 < EMA20=0.39702, RSI=27.83), 15m bearish (price=0.3846 < EMA20=0.38621, RSI=39.69), 3m bearish (price=0.3846 < EMA20=0.38519, RSI=37.65) with volume ratio=0.30 (WEAK). All timeframes aligned bearish, supporting hold. Unrealized PnL positive. Invalidation condition: if 1h price closes above EMA20 (0.39702). Hold.\n\nLINK: 1h bearish (price=12.2 < EMA20=12.4828, RSI=28.95), 15m bearish (price=12.16 < EMA20=12.1786, RSI=43.99), 3m bearish (price=12.16 < EMA20=12.1698, RSI=45.76) with volume ratio=0.83 (NORMAL). All timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume. Trend-following SHORT setup; short slots available=1. Confidence high due to strong alignment and volume. Target below support, stop above EMA20.\n\nSOL: 1h bearish (price=127.38 < EMA20=130.1715, RSI=30.29), 15m bearish (price=127.15 < EMA20=127.2524, RSI=44.71), 3m bullish (price=127.15 > EMA20=127.1307, RSI=49.90) with volume ratio=0.36 (WEAK). 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM) but 1h and 15m bearish; counter-trend LONG possible but risk_level=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK and volume weak, so confidence low (<0.65). No clear edge; hold.\n\nOverall, prioritize SHORT setups for ASTER and LINK due to strong bearish alignment and available slots. Avoid LONGs due to weak volume and low confidence.

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish with all coins in BEARISH market regime. Position slots: short slots full (2 used, 0 available), long slots available (2). Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE, so do NOT force LONG trades unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence. Counter-trade analysis is empty, no counter-trend opportunities identified. Trend reversal data: XRP and SOL show 3m reversal with MEDIUM strength, but no positions exist, so ignore for exits. ASTER and ADA have short positions; no reversal signals. Volume analysis: Most coins have WEAK volume (ratio <=0.50x), except LINK and SOL have NORMAL volume. Hard rule: Do not trade if volume ratio <=0.20x; all are above 0.20x but caution for low volume. Cooldown status: No directional or coin cooldowns. Risk management: Maintain at least 1:1.3 risk-reward, use 1h ATR for stops. HARD MARGIN STOP LOSS at 3-7% loss; set tight stops.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=2.044 < EMA20=2.092, RSI 29.03), 15m BEARISH (price=2.0409 < EMA20=2.0458, RSI 42.55), 3m BULLISH (price=2.0419 > EMA20=2.0414, RSI 49.95). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume WEAK (0.36x). No clear edge for LONG (counter-trend) as 3m reversal is MEDIUM but volume weak and slots constraint: LONG available but need LOW/MEDIUM_RISK; confidence low due to mixed alignment and weak volume. HOLD.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13731 < EMA20=0.14104, RSI 24.39), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13669 < EMA20=0.13736, RSI 35.93), 3m BEARISH (price=0.13677 < EMA20=0.13695, RSI 38.55). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume WEAK (0.42x). Strong trend-following SHORT setup, but short slots are full (0 available). Cannot open SHORT. No counter-trend signal for LONG. HOLD.\n\nASTER: Has short position. 1h BEARISH (price=1.002 < EMA20=1.0204, RSI 34.28), 15m BEARISH (price=0.985 < EMA20=0.9975, RSI 33.59), 3m BEARISH (price=0.986 < EMA20=0.9926, RSI 35.28). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume WEAK (0.24x). Position is losing (-0.66 PnL), but no reversal signals (3m reversal false). Invalidation condition: If 1h price closes above 1h EMA20 (1.0204). Current price 1.002, still below. Continue holding, monitor for stop loss.\n\nADA: Has short position. 1h BEARISH (price=0.3861 < EMA20=0.39702, RSI 27.83), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3836 < EMA20=0.38595, RSI 36.46), 3m BEARISH (price=0.3839 < EMA20=0.38483, RSI 32.95). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume WEAK (0.30x). Position is profitable (+0.21 PnL). No reversal signals. Invalidation condition: If 1h price closes above 1h EMA20 (0.39702). Current price 0.3861, still below. Continue holding, target profit.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.2 < EMA20=12.4828, RSI 28.95), 15m BEARISH (price=12.15 < EMA20=12.1759, RSI 42.87), 3m NEUTRAL/BULLISH (price=12.16 > EMA20=12.1647, RSI 47.55). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m slightly bullish. Volume NORMAL (0.64x). No clear edge for LONG (counter-trend) as 3m reversal not strong; slots constraint: LONG available but need LOW/MEDIUM_RISK; confidence low due to mixed alignment. HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=127.38 < EMA20=130.1715, RSI 30.29), 15m BEARISH (price=127.13 < EMA20=127.2407, RSI 44.42), 3m BULLISH (price=127.19 > EMA20=127.1342, RSI 52.07). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume NORMAL (0.63x). Trend reversal data shows 3m reversal MEDIUM, but no position. Potential counter-trend LONG opportunity, but slots constraint: LONG available, need LOW/MEDIUM_RISK. Risk level: MEDIUM_RISK (3m alignment + volume normal). Confidence >0.65? Evaluate: 3m bullish with RSI 52.07, but 1h and 15m bearish, so confidence moderate ~0.6. Not high enough for counter-trend (requires >0.65). HOLD.\n\nOverall: No high-confidence setups. Maintain existing positions. Do not force trades due to slot constraints and weak signals.",
