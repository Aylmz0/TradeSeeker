All timeframes (1h, 15m, 3m) show BULLISH alignment per COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS, but risk_level is VERY_HIGH_RISK due to alignment_strength NONE and volume_strength WEAK (volume_ratio 0.39). Price_location UPPER_10 on 15m suggests potential pullback risk. Volume low (tags: Vol_Low), efficiency_ratio 0.2 (CHOPPY). No clear edge for LONG or SHORT; prefer HOLD during startup.\n\nTRX: Market regime BEARISH. 1h (htf) trend: price=0.284 < EMA20=0.285, RSI 38.0 (oversold), structure LH_LL (bearish), momentum WEAKENING, ADX MODERATE (28.8). 15m trend: price=0.2841 < EMA20=0.2844, RSI 42.2 (neutral), momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10 (percentile 0), ADX WEAK (19.1). 3m trend: price=0.2841 < EMA20=0.2843, RSI 40.8 (neutral), ADX STRONG (52.1). All timeframes (1h, 15m, 3m) show BEARISH alignment per COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS, but risk_level is VERY_HIGH_RISK due to alignment_strength NONE and volume_strength WEAK (volume_ratio 0.58). Price_location LOWER_10 on 15m suggests potential bounce risk. Efficiency_ratio 0.56 (TRENDING), but momentum weakening across timeframes. No clear edge for LONG or SHORT; prefer HOLD during startup.\n\nOverall: Both coins show VERY_HIGH_RISK per counter-trade analysis, and no exceptional setups with high confidence (>0.7) are present. Position slots: 0 used, 1 available, so capacity exists, but discipline in startup mode advises observation. Global regime bullish, but no strong signals align. Decision: HOLD for all coins.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Analysis for all assets based on system rules:\n\n1. **Global Context**: Market regime is bullish (strength 0.5), but no positions exist. Position slots: 0/3 used, 2 long and 2 short slots available. No cooldowns active. Startup behavior: Cycle 3 completed, normal trading mode applies from cycle 4 onward.\n\n2. **Per-Asset Analysis**: MARKET_DATA is empty ([]), meaning no price or indicator data provided for any coin (XRP, DOGE, ASTER, TRX, LINK, SOL). Without market data, I cannot analyze 1h, 15m, or 3m timeframes, check alignment, volume, or other indicators as required by the analysis process. According to the data protocol, the supplied data is the authoritative source; absence of data means no actionable setups can be evaluated.\n\n3. **Constraints Check**: Position slots allow up to 3 positions, with 2 slots per direction available. However, without market data, I cannot identify any high-probability setups (min confidence 0.4) or apply entry/exit logic. The discipline rule (SNIPER MODE) requires only trading high-probability setups; holding cash is valid when no clear edge exists.\n\n4. **Decision Rationale**: Since MARKET_DATA is empty, there is no basis to assess trends, momentum, or quantified edges for any coin. I cannot propose entries (buy_to_enter or sell_to_enter) as this would violate the requirement to use data explicitly (e.g., compare price vs. EMA). No positions exist to close. Therefore, the only valid decision for all coins is HOLD, as per startup behavior and general rules to avoid impulsive entries without data support.\n\n5. **Risk Management**: No trades proposed, so risk management rules (stop-loss, invalidation) do not apply. Capital remains at initial balance of 500.\n\nConclusion: Due to missing market data, I cannot perform the required multi-timeframe analysis. I will HOLD all coins and wait for data in future cycles.",

Cooldowns: none. Counter-trade analysis provided for XRP and DOGE.\n\nXRP: htf BEARISH (price=1.9034 < EMA20=1.9153, RSI 40.8, ADX 35 MODERATE, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING), 15m BEARISH (price=1.902 < EMA20=1.9047, RSI 43.1, structure RANGE, momentum STABLE, ADX 30 MODERATE), 3m BEARISH (price=1.902 < EMA20=1.9036, RSI 44.8, ADX 17 WEAK). All timeframes aligned bearish with volume ratio 0.54 (NORMAL), OBV trend FALLING on 3m but RISING on 15m with BULLISH divergence. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength NONE, conditions total_met 1, volume_ratio 0.31 WEAK). Per counter_trend rules: VERY_HIGH_RISK means DO NOT trade. Also, volume_ratio 0.31 > 0.20, so not blocked by hard rule. SuperTrend UP on all timeframes conflicts with bearish price vs EMA; caution. No clear edge, HOLD.\n\nDOGE: htf BULLISH (price=0.1331 > EMA20=0.1326, RSI 54.6, ADX 26 MODERATE, structure LH_LL but momentum WEAKENING, price_location MIDDLE percentile 62), 15m BULLISH (price=0.13279 > EMA20=0.13258, RSI 52.9, structure HH_HL, momentum WEAKENING, ADX 39 MODERATE), 3m BEARISH (price=0.13279 < EMA20=0.13289, RSI 48.0, ADX 31 MODERATE). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bullish but 3m bearish, and 15m momentum WEAKENING. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength MEDIUM, conditions total_met 2, volume_ratio 0.57 WEAK). Per counter_trend rules: HIGH_RISK requires extreme caution; but this is not a counter-trade as htf_trend BULLISH and 15m_trend BULLISH, so trend-following LONG possible. However, check zone_weakening rule: 15m price_location MIDDLE (percentile 78, near UPPER_10) and momentum WEAKENING. For LONG entry: UPPER_10_WEAKENING says DO NOT open LONG. Trend exhausted at highs. Prefer HOLD or evaluate SHORT. Volume ratio 0.57 WEAK, but 3m volume_ratio 1.86 STRONG. Overall, mixed with weakening momentum, HOLD.\n\nOther coins (ASTER, TRX, LINK, SOL) not provided in data; assume no data or not tradable, HOLD.\n\nDecision: No high-confidence setups. XRP bearish but counter-trade risk VERY_HIGH_RISK blocks. DOGE bullish but zone_weakening rule blocks LONG. Maintain discipline: SNIPER MODE, only trade high-probability setups. All HOLD.",

Global regime is neutral (bullish_count=2, bearish_count=1, neutral_count=3). No positions open, all slots available. Startup cycles 1-3: observe unless exceptional setup. Cycle 13: normal trading mode. Apply all rules.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=1.8968 < EMA20=1.9147, RSI 37.7, ADX 35.8 MODERATE, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING). 15m BEARISH (RSI 37.4, structure RANGE, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 3m BEARISH (RSI 32.5, bb_signal OVERSOLD).

Zone_weakening rule: 15m momentum WEAKENING + price_location MIDDLE = no extreme risk. However, 3m bearish suggests weak entry timing.

Zone_weakening rule: price_location UPPER_10 + RSI 61.8 >75 indicates pullback risk. Combined with VERY_HIGH_RISK counter-trade, DO NOT LONG. HOLD.\n\nTRX: 1h BEARISH (price=0.284 < EMA20=0.2849, RSI 38.0, ADX 29.0 MODERATE, structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING). 15m BEARISH (RSI 43.2, structure HH_HL conflicting, momentum STABLE, price_location MIDDLE). 3m BULLISH (RSI 48.9). Mixed signals: 1h+15m bearish but 3m bullish. Counter-trade analysis: HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength MEDIUM, conditions total_met=2).

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis of all 6 assets using multi-timeframe approach. Cycle 16 (12 minutes in), startup caution no longer applies. Global regime bullish (strength 0.5) but mixed individual regimes. Position slots: 1 open (XRP SHORT), 4 available (2 LONG, 1 SHORT slots). No cooldowns active. Must evaluate both LONG and SHORT opportunities, choosing best quantified edge.\n\nXRP: Currently in SHORT position (-0.92 PnL, 10 min duration). 1h BEARISH (price=1.8968 < EMA20=1.9147, RSI 37.7, ADX 36 MODERATE, structure LH_LL). 15m BEARISH (price=1.8987 < EMA20=1.9038, RSI 39.3, momentum STRENGTHENING). 3m NEUTRAL (RSI 42.0, price=1.8995 ≈ EMA20=1.9014). Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment NONE). Reversal signals: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL only. Erosion_status NONE. Position still valid - 1h+15m bearish alignment, 3m neutral not strong enough to close. Continue holding.\n\nDOGE: 1h NEUTRAL (price=0.13276 ≈ EMA20=0.13256, RSI 52.3, ADX 26 MODERATE, structure LH_LL but momentum WEAKENING). 15m BULLISH (price=0.13278 > EMA20=0.13259, RSI 52.8, structure HH_HL, momentum STRENGTHENING). 3m BULLISH (price=0.13295 > EMA20=0.13288, RSI 52.8). Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment NONE). Volume ratio 0.84 (NORMAL). No reversal signals. Mixed signals: 15m+3m bullish but 1h neutral with weakening momentum. Price_location MIDDLE (53%). No clear edge. HOLD.\n\nASTER: 1h BULLISH (price=0.709 > EMA20=0.7067, RSI 51.0, ADX 19 WEAK, momentum WEAKENING). 15m BULLISH (price=0.71 > EMA20=0.7046, RSI 63.3, ADX 58 STRONG, price_location UPPER_10). 3m BULLISH (price=0.711 > EMA20=0.7096, RSI 57.8). Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment NONE). Volume ratio 1.23 (NORMAL). Reversal: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL. Critical: 15m price_location UPPER_10 + momentum STABLE (not WEAKENING) - not zone_weakening combo. However, RSI 63.3 approaching overbought, price near resistance. Risk: UPPER_10 reduces LONG confidence. No SHORT setup (1h bullish). HOLD.\n\nTRX: Data incomplete in market_data but reversal data shows: 1h BEARISH, 3m NEUTRAL, reversal INFORMATIONAL with MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Without full indicators, cannot assess edge. HOLD.\n\nLINK: No market_data provided. Reversal data: 1h NEUTRAL, 3m NEUTRAL, no reversal. Cannot analyze. HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h NEUTRAL (price=126.06 ≈ EMA20=126.14, RSI 49.6, ADX 23 WEAK, momentum WEAKENING). 15m BULLISH (price=126.1 > EMA20=126.02, RSI 51.5, structure HH_HL, momentum WEAKENING, price_location MIDDLE). 3m BULLISH (price=126.34 > EMA20=126.31, RSI 51.7). Counter-trade analysis: MEDIUM_RISK (alignment STRONG) - this is counter-trend opportunity (15m+3m bullish vs 1h neutral). Volume ratio 0.56 (WEAK). No reversal signals. Check zone_weakening: 15m momentum WEAKENING but price_location MIDDLE (73%) - not zone_weakening combo. Counter-trade rules: MEDIUM_RISK requires confidence > 0.65. Current setup: 15m+3m bullish alignment, 1h neutral (not bearish), ADX weak. Confidence estimated 0.6-0.65 borderline. Volume weak (0.56x). Not high enough conviction. HOLD.\n\nOverall: Only XRP position active. No new high-confidence setups. Maintain discipline - SNIPER MODE requires clear edge.",

Without market data, I cannot perform technical analysis on any asset. According to the data protocol, the supplied data is the authoritative source for every decision. Since no market data is available, I cannot evaluate 1h, 15m, or 3m indicators, volume, open interest, funding, or any technical setups.\\n\\nCONSTRAINTS CHECK:\\n- XRP is in cooldown: MUST NOT trade per rules.\\n- No other coins have data to analyze.\\n- Position slots: 5 available, no constraints on direction.\\n- Startup behavior: Cycle 20 (invoked 20 times) is beyond cycles 1-3, so normal trading mode applies, but no data to act on.\\n\\nDECISION: Without market data, I cannot identify any high-probability setups or quantify edges.

All timeframes aligned bullish (htf BULLISH, 15m BULLISH, 3m BULLISH) with volume ratio 1.08x (normal). However, COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS shows risk_level=VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength=NONE, conditions total_met=2). According to counter_trend rules: VERY_HIGH_RISK means 'Do NOT trade'. Additionally, 15m price_location=UPPER_10 + RSI 72.9 indicates potential pullback risk. Combined with momentum WEAKENING on 1h, this suggests trend exhaustion at highs. Zone_weakening rule: UPPER_10 + WEAKENING → for LONG entry: DO NOT open LONG. Trend exhausted at highs. Prefer HOLD or evaluate SHORT. For SHORT entry: GOOD counter-trend opportunity if conditions align. But counter_trade_analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK, so SHORT is also invalid. Therefore, HOLD.\n\nOther coins (XRP, DOGE, TRX, LINK, SOL): No market data provided in this prompt. Cannot analyze without data. Assume HOLD for all.\n\nPosition Slots: long_slots_available=2, short_slots_available=2, available_slots=5. No constraints.\n\nCooldown Status: XRP in cooldown (3 cycles). Do NOT trade XRP. Others clear.\n\nMarket Regime: Global bullish with strength 0.5. Suggestions indicate bullish regime with zero exposure, but no high-confidence setups found.\n\nStartup Behavior: Cycle 21 (invoked 21 times). Normal trading mode applies (cycles 4+).\n\nOverall: No clear edge for ASTER due to VERY_HIGH_RISK counter_trade and zone_weakening. Other coins not analyzable.

Cycle 28: startup behavior no longer applies. Global regime is neutral (strength 0.17), with 1 bearish, 5 neutral coins. Position slots: 1 open (TRX short), 4 available (2 long, 1 short slots). Short performance has 1 loss (-$2.75), but no cooldown. Counter-trend opportunities evaluated per risk_level rules. Volume ratio >0.20 for all coins, so no hard volume rule violations. Apply zone_weakening_combined_rule where relevant. For each coin:\n\nXRP: htf BEARISH (price=1.902 < EMA20=1.9136, RSI 41.1, ADX 37 MODERATE), 15m BEARISH (structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING, RSI 45.8), 3m BEARISH (RSI 31.9, OVERSOLD). All timeframes aligned bearish with volume ratio 2.38 STRONG. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength NONE, total_met 2) - per rules, do NOT trade counter-trend. Trend-following SHORT is valid, but check zone_weakening: 15m price_location MIDDLE, no extreme zone. However, 15m momentum WEAKENING suggests trend exhaustion; combined with bearish alignment, prefer HOLD to avoid entering a weakening downtrend. Reversal signals: NONE. No position. Decision: HOLD.\n\nDOGE: htf BULLISH (price=0.1333 > EMA20=0.1326, RSI 55.7, ADX 26 MODERATE), 15m BULLISH (structure HH_HL, momentum WEAKENING, RSI 54.1), 3m BEARISH (RSI 30.9, OVERSOLD). Mixed signals: 1h+15m bullish vs 3m bearish. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength MEDIUM, total_met 2) - per rules, HIGH_RISK requires extreme caution; prefer HOLD. Additionally, 15m momentum WEAKENING and price_location UPPER_10 (percentile 81) combined with RSI 54.1 not >75, but zone_weakening_combined_rule: UPPER_10 + WEAKENING for LONG entry: DO NOT open LONG. For SHORT entry: GOOD counter-trend opportunity, but risk_level HIGH_RISK and slots: short_slots_available=1, but constraint: if valid counter-trend (e.g., SHORT) but cannot execute due to slots, do not open trend-following opposite (LONG). Here, SHORT is counter-trend (against htf BULLISH), but risk_level HIGH_RISK advises caution. Reversal signals: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL against htf. Decision: HOLD.\n\nASTER: htf BULLISH (price=0.718 > EMA20=0.7082, RSI 57.1, ADX 21 WEAK), 15m BULLISH (structure UNCLEAR, momentum STABLE, RSI 67.8, price_location UPPER_10 percentile 93), 3m BEARISH (RSI 40.6). Mixed signals. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level MEDIUM_RISK (alignment_strength MEDIUM, total_met 3) - per rules, MEDIUM_RISK allows execution if confidence >0.65. However, 15m price_location UPPER_10 + momentum STABLE (not WEAKENING), but RSI 67.8 >75? No, but high. Zone_weakening_combined_rule: UPPER_10 + STABLE not specified, but caution for LONG entry. For SHORT entry: counter-trend against htf BULLISH, risk_level MEDIUM_RISK allows execution. Volume ratio 2.02 STRONG supports. But check slots: short_slots_available=1. However, 3m RSI 40.6 not oversold, and 15m structure UNCLEAR reduces confidence. Confidence estimated 0.6 < min 0.4 but <0.65 for counter-trend. Decision: HOLD.\n\nTRX: htf BEARISH (price=0.2841 < EMA20=0.2848, RSI 39.9, ADX 29 MODERATE), 15m BEARISH (structure LH_LL, momentum STABLE, RSI 44.3), 3m BULLISH (RSI 55.1). Mixed signals. Existing SHORT position: unrealized_pnl -$0.42, erosion_status NONE. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength MEDIUM, total_met 2) - for existing position, not applicable for entry. Reversal signals: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL against position (since SHORT, 3m BULLISH is reversal). Strength INFORMATIONAL only, per rules: may be noise, continue watching. Loss_risk_signal MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Check exit logic: reversal_strength INFORMATIONAL + erosion_status NONE = no close signal. Invalidation_condition: If 1h price closes above 1h EMA20 * 1.002 (0.2848*1.002=0.2854). Current price 0.2841 < 0.2854, thesis not invalidated. Decision: HOLD position.\n\nLINK: htf BULLISH (price=12.63 > EMA20=12.6034, RSI 52.6, ADX 28 MODERATE), 15m BULLISH (structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, RSI 55.1, price_location MIDDLE percentile 86), 3m BEARISH (RSI 33.5, OVERSOLD). Mixed signals. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength MEDIUM, total_met 2) - prefer HOLD. 15m momentum WEAKENING suggests trend exhaustion. Volume ratio 1.26 NORMAL. No zone extremes. Reversal signals: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL. Decision: HOLD.\n\nSOL: htf NEUTRAL (market_regime NEUTRAL, price=126.28 > EMA20=126.16, RSI 51.1, ADX 22 WEAK), 15m BULLISH (structure HH_HL, momentum WEAKENING, RSI 57.9, price_location UPPER_10 percentile 91), 3m BEARISH (RSI 34.5, OVERSOLD). Mixed signals with htf neutral. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength MEDIUM, total_met 2) - prefer HOLD. Zone_weakening_combined_rule: UPPER_10 + WEAKENING for LONG entry: DO NOT open LONG. For SHORT entry: counter-trend against 15m BULLISH, but htf NEUTRAL, so not strictly counter-trend? Risk_level HIGH_RISK advises caution. Volume ratio 1.71 NORMAL. Reversal signals: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL. Decision: HOLD.\n\nOverall: No high-confidence setups meeting min_confidence 0.4 and risk rules. All coins have mixed or weakening signals.

HOLD.\n\nDOGE: 1h BULLISH (price=0.1333 > EMA20=0.1326, RSI 55.7, ADX 26 MODERATE), 15m BEARISH (momentum WEAKENING, RSI 45.2, structure HH_HL), 3m BEARISH (RSI 34.0). Conflict: 1h bullish vs 15m/3m bearish. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level MEDIUM_RISK (alignment STRONG, conditions 2). Volume ratio 0.50x (WEAK). Price_location MIDDLE. Zone_weakening rule: 15m momentum WEAKENING but price_location MIDDLE, no extreme zone. Can consider SHORT as counter-trend with confidence > 0.65. However, 3m RSI 34.0 oversold, may bounce. Confidence moderate. HOLD.\n\nASTER: 1h BULLISH (price=0.718 > EMA20=0.7082, RSI 57.1, ADX 21 WEAK), 15m BULLISH (RSI 57.3, momentum WEAKENING), 3m BEARISH (RSI 41.9). Mixed signals. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level HIGH_RISK (alignment MEDIUM, conditions 2). Volume ratio 1.33x (NORMAL). Price_location MIDDLE on 15m (74th percentile). Zone_weakening rule: 15m momentum WEAKENING but price_location MIDDLE, no extreme zone. HIGH_RISK counter-trend: evaluate carefully, prefer HOLD. Also, 1h ADX WEAK (21.4), trend not strong. HOLD.\n\nTRX: Existing SHORT position (unrealized PnL -$0.62, confidence 0.631). 1h BEARISH (price=0.2841 < EMA20=0.2848, RSI 39.9, ADX 29 MODERATE), 15m BULLISH (structure LH_LL, momentum STABLE, RSI 49.5), 3m BULLISH (RSI 59.1, bb_signal OVERBOUGHT). Trend reversal: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL (against short). Loss risk signal MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Erosion_status NONE (<20% peak profit erosion). Combined decision: erosion NONE + reversal INFORMATIONAL = continue holding. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level LOW_RISK for LONG (alignment STRONG, conditions 3, volume ratio 8.88x STRONG). But cannot LONG due to existing short position (same coin). Maintain SHORT with stop loss at 0.2847517, invalidation if 1h price > EMA20*1.002.\n\nLINK: 1h BULLISH (price=12.63 > EMA20=12.60, RSI 52.6, ADX 28 MODERATE), 15m BEARISH (momentum WEAKENING, RSI 43.1), 3m BEARISH (RSI 36.4). Conflict. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level MEDIUM_RISK (alignment STRONG, conditions 2). Volume ratio 0.71x (NORMAL). Price_location MIDDLE. Zone_weakening rule: 15m momentum WEAKENING but price_location MIDDLE. Can consider SHORT as counter-trend with confidence > 0.65. However, 1h structure LH_LL bearish but momentum WEAKENING, ADX MODERATE. Confidence moderate. HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h NEUTRAL (price=126.28 vs EMA20=126.16, RSI 51.1, ADX 22 WEAK), 15m BEARISH (momentum WEAKENING, RSI 45.3, structure HH_HL), 3m BEARISH (RSI 35.7, bb_signal OVERSOLD). 1h neutral, 15m/3m bearish. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level MEDIUM_RISK (alignment STRONG, conditions 2). Volume ratio 1.22x (NORMAL). Price_location MIDDLE. Zone_weakening rule: 15m momentum WEAKENING but price_location MIDDLE. Can consider SHORT as counter-trend with confidence > 0.65. However, 3m RSI 35.7 oversold, may bounce. Confidence moderate. HOLD.\n\nOverall: No high-confidence setups (all <0.65). TRX position held. Others HOLD due to mixed signals, risk levels, or oversold conditions. Maintain discipline: SNIPER MODE, only trade high-probability setups.",
