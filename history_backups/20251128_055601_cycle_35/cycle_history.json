All timeframes remain bearish aligned with normal volume (ratio=1.16). No reversal signals. Holding position with existing exit plan.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.084 < EMA20=1.0948, RSI=40.85), 15m BEARISH (price=1.085 < EMA20=1.0919, RSI=35.66), 3m BEARISH (price=1.083 < EMA20=1.0863, RSI=36.97). All timeframes aligned bearish but volume extremely weak (ratio=0.04). Weak volume reduces confidence materially. Skipping due to volume weakness despite bearish alignment.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4311 < EMA20=0.43265, RSI=48.43), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4311 < EMA20=0.43355, RSI=38.00), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4303 < EMA20=0.43177, RSI=36.60). All timeframes aligned bearish but volume weak (ratio=0.06). Weak volume reduces confidence. Skipping due to volume weakness.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=13.34 < EMA20=13.382, RSI=48.66), 15m BEARISH (price=13.34 < EMA20=13.3865, RSI=39.50), 3m BEARISH (price=13.31 < EMA20=13.3398, RSI=41.98). All timeframes aligned bearish but volume extremely weak (ratio=0.02). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal signal (strength=INFORMATIONAL), but this is only informational and against no existing position. Weak volume and reversal signal reduce confidence. Skipping.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=140.85 < EMA20=141.73, RSI=44.83), 15m BEARISH (price=140.85 < EMA20=141.38, RSI=40.13), 3m BEARISH (price=140.69 < EMA20=140.87, RSI=43.65). All timeframes aligned bearish but volume weak (ratio=0.18). Weak volume reduces confidence. Skipping due to volume weakness.\n\nGlobal regime neutral with bearish bias. SHORT slots available (1), LONG slots available (2). No cooldowns active. Only XRP and DOGE show sufficient volume strength for confident entries. XRP offers best new SHORT opportunity with aligned bearish trends and normal volume.",

All timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume (ratio=0.725). Existing SHORT position is profitable (PnL=0.122). No reversal signals. Continue holding.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15202 < EMA20=0.1532, RSI=41.508), 15m BEARISH (price=0.15202 < EMA20=0.1529, RSI=30.446), 3m BEARISH (price=0.15175 < EMA20=0.1523, RSI=32.387).

Continue holding.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.087 < EMA20=1.0944, RSI=42.437), 15m BEARISH (price=1.087 < EMA20=1.0917, RSI=40.293), 3m BULLISH (price=1.089 > EMA20=1.0869, RSI=54.326). Counter-trend setup: 3m bullish against 1h bearish trend. Volume normal (ratio=0.515). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM. This is a valid counter-trend LONG opportunity. However, short_slots_available=0 (SHORT_FULL), so cannot open LONG due to constraint: 'If a direction is FULL, do NOT force trades in the other direction unless they are LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK'. Counter-trend trades are inherently HIGH_RISK, so skip. Also, counter-trend restriction applies: valid counter-trend signal exists but cannot execute, so DO NOT open trend-following SHORT. Hold.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4304 < EMA20=0.4324, RSI=47.168), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4304 < EMA20=0.4332, RSI=35.091), 3m BEARISH (price=0.429 < EMA20=0.4311, RSI=31.454). All timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume (ratio=1.181). Strong trend-following SHORT setup. But short_slots_available=0, so cannot open new SHORT. Hold.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=13.33 < EMA20=13.3753, RSI=48.089), 15m BEARISH (price=13.33 < EMA20=13.3794, RSI=38.333), 3m BEARISH (price=13.3 < EMA20=13.3325, RSI=38.986). All timeframes aligned bearish, but volume WEAK (ratio=0.068). Weak volume reduces confidence. short_slots_available=0, so cannot open SHORT.

All timeframes aligned bearish, but volume WEAK (ratio=0.139). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=INFORMATIONAL (only 3m reversal, not strong). Weak volume and informational reversal reduce confidence. short_slots_available=0, so cannot open SHORT. Hold.\n\nSummary: Two existing SHORT positions (XRP, DOGE) are profitable and aligned with bearish trends. No reversal signals for them. ASTER has counter-trend LONG signal but cannot execute due to slot constraints. Other coins have bearish setups but no short slots available. Global regime neutral, but most coins bearish.

All timeframes aligned bearish with zero volume (ratio=0). Volume absence makes this too risky despite bearish alignment. Skip due to volume weakness.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=141 < EMA20=141.673, RSI=45.891), 15m BEARISH (price=141 < EMA20=141.3526, RSI=42.51), 3m BEARISH (price=140.17 < EMA20=140.7504, RSI=33.034). All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (ratio=0.014). Strong trend-following SHORT setup, but short slots limited (1 available, and DOGE has stronger signals). Hold for now.\n\nMarket regime: Global neutral but individual coins mostly bearish. Short performance strong (2 wins, 0 losses). Position slots: 1 short slot available, 2 long slots available. Volume weakness pervasive across all coins, reducing confidence materially. Best opportunities: DOGE for trend-following SHORT, ASTER for counter-trend LONG.",

Global regime is neutral with bearish bias (bearish count 1, neutral count 5). Position slots: 2 short positions open, 0 short slots available, 2 long slots available. Counter-trend signals must be prioritized; if valid but slots full, do not open trend-following trades in opposite direction. Volume is weak across all coins (ratio <= 0.038), reducing confidence. No cooldowns active. Short performance is profitable (net PnL 1.07, profitability index 100), but short slots full, so no new short entries allowed. Focus on long opportunities if high confidence and low risk.\n\nXRP: 1h bearish (price=2.1921 < EMA20=2.2043, RSI 44.58), 15m bearish (price=2.1851 < EMA20=2.2026, RSI 29.35), 3m bearish (price=2.1841 < EMA20=2.1901, RSI 28.93).

Counter-trend setup: 15m and 3m align bullish against 1h bearish trend. Alignment strength MEDIUM, risk HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.000278 (weak). Reversal signals: 3m reversal true (strength MEDIUM).

All timeframes aligned bearish. Counter-trade analysis shows no counter-trend setup. Volume ratio 0.840 (NORMAL) is better, but risk level VERY_HIGH_RISK. Reversal signal: 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL) but not strong. Short slots full, so cannot open new SHORT. Hold.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=13.17 < EMA20=13.342, RSI 38.70), 15m BEARISH (price=13.18 < EMA20=13.2902, RSI 28.80), 3m BEARISH (price=13.18 < EMA20=13.1908, RSI 43.72). All timeframes aligned bearish. Counter-trade analysis shows no counter-trend setup. Volume ratio 0.140 (WEAK) and risk level VERY_HIGH_RISK. Reversal signal: 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL).

Hold.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=139.11 < EMA20=141.2609, RSI 36.62), 15m BEARISH (price=138.95 < EMA20=140.3173, RSI 31.47), 3m BEARISH (price=138.95 < EMA20=139.1276, RSI 40.77). All timeframes aligned bearish. Counter-trade analysis shows no counter-trend setup. Volume ratio 0.362 (WEAK) and risk level VERY_HIGH_RISK. Reversal signal: 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL) against existing SHORT position, but strength is INFORMATIONAL (only 3m), so continue monitoring. Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL +0.257. Given short slots full and no strong counter-trend, hold position.\n\nOverall: Short slots full (0 available), long slots available (2). Counter-trend opportunities (e.g., XRP LONG) exist but cannot be executed due to slot constraints. Per rules, DO NOT force trend-following trades in opposite direction. Market regime neutral globally, but most coins bearish. Volume mostly weak, reducing confidence. No high-confidence setups for new entries. Focus on managing existing positions.",
