    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish (strength 0.83), with most coins in bearish regimes. Position slots: 0 used, 1 available, long and short slots both available (2 each). No cooldowns active. Volume is weak across all coins (ratio <= 0.26x), violating the hard rule for volume ratio <= 0.20x, so no trades should be executed. Holding cash is the optimal strategy to avoid low-conviction setups.\n\nXRP: 1h neutral (price=2.2017 ≈ EMA20=2.2001, RSI 51.28), 15m neutral (price=2.2016 ≈ EMA20=2.2030, RSI 48.94), 3m neutral (price=2.2016 ≈ EMA20=2.2034, RSI 45.17). All timeframes show mixed signals with weak volume (ratio 0.15x). No clear edge; hold.\n\nDOGE: 1h bearish (price=0.14808 < EMA20=0.1490, RSI 41.15), 15m bearish (price=0.14807 < EMA20=0.1484, RSI 44.79), 3m bearish (price=0.14807 < EMA20=0.1482, RSI 42.90). Bearish alignment but volume weak (ratio 0.018x). Skip due to low volume.\n\nASTER: 1h bearish (price=1.044 < EMA20=1.0694, RSI 33.64), 15m bearish (price=1.044 < EMA20=1.0499, RSI 36.83), 3m neutral (price=1.044 ≈ EMA20=1.0439, RSI 48.44). Mixed lower timeframes with weak volume (ratio 0.0096x). No clear edge; hold.\n\nADA: 1h bearish (price=0.4152 < EMA20=0.4172, RSI 43.17), 15m neutral (price=0.4152 ≈ EMA20=0.4158, RSI 47.36), 3m neutral (price=0.4152 ≈ EMA20=0.4156, RSI 44.56). Mixed signals with weak volume (ratio 0.26x). No clear edge; hold.\n\nLINK: 1h bearish (price=12.97 < EMA20=13.0718, RSI 38.85), 15m bearish (price=12.97 < EMA20=13.0112, RSI 39.70), 3m bearish (price=12.97 < EMA20=12.9867, RSI 42.71). Bearish alignment but volume weak (ratio 0x). Skip due to low volume.\n\nSOL: 1h bearish (price=135.82 < EMA20=136.7506, RSI 39.22), 15m bearish (price=135.82 < EMA20=136.0133, RSI 45.62), 3m neutral (price=135.82 ≈ EMA20=135.8491, RSI 47.82).

Global regime is bearish (strength 0.83), with 5 bearish and 1 neutral coin. Position slots: 2 shorts open, 0 short slots available, 2 long slots available. Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE, so only consider LONG entries if high confidence and low/medium risk, or hold. No cooldowns active. Volume is weak for most coins (ratio <0.5x), reducing confidence. Reversal signals show MEDIUM 3m reversals for DOGE, ASTER, ADA, LINK, SOL, indicating potential bullish momentum against bearish htf trends, but slots limit actions. Analyze each coin: XRP: htf bullish (price=2.2017 > EMA20=2.2001, RSI 51.28), 15m bearish (price=2.1991 < EMA20=2.2024, RSI 47.13), 3m bullish (price=2.2047 > EMA20=2.2023, RSI 56.24). Mixed signals; 1h bullish but 15m bearish suggests neutral regime. Volume weak (0.086x), no clear edge for LONG. DOGE: htf bearish (price=0.14808 < EMA20=0.1490, RSI 41.15), 15m bearish (price=0.14803 < EMA20=0.1483, RSI 44.23), 3m bullish (price=0.14854 > EMA20=0.1482, RSI 60.86). Counter-trend LONG possible (3m bullish vs htf bearish), but volume weak (0.104x), confidence low. ASTER: htf bearish (price=1.044 < EMA20=1.0694, RSI 33.64), 15m bearish (price=1.041 < EMA20=1.0488, RSI 33.35), 3m bullish (price=1.044 > EMA20=1.0431, RSI 51.47). Counter-trend LONG possible, but volume weak (0.067x), confidence low. ADA: Has SHORT position, unrealized PnL negative. htf bearish (price=0.4152 < EMA20=0.4172, RSI 43.17), 15m bearish (price=0.4137 < EMA20=0.4155, RSI 42.81), 3m bullish (price=0.4163 > EMA20=0.4151, RSI 59.74). 3m reversal MEDIUM strength, but invalidation not met (1h price not above EMA20). Hold position. LINK: Has SHORT position, unrealized PnL negative. htf bearish (price=12.97 < EMA20=13.0718, RSI 38.85), 15m bearish (price=12.95 < EMA20=13.0045, RSI 36.88), 3m bullish (price=13.01 > EMA20=12.9814, RSI 59.71). 3m reversal MEDIUM strength, but invalidation not met (1h price not above EMA20).

Invalidation not triggered (1h price > EMA20).\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.14808 < EMA20=0.1490, RSI 41.15), 15m NEUTRAL (price=0.14861 ≈ EMA20=0.1484, RSI 52.59), 3m BULLISH (price=0.14861 > EMA20=0.1483, RSI 60.52). Mixed signals with 1h bearish but 3m bullish. Volume weak (0.32x) - DO NOT TRADE per hard rule (volume ratio <= 0.50x reduces confidence significantly). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal MEDIUM strength. No clear edge, hold.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.044 < EMA20=1.0694, RSI 33.64), 15m BEARISH (price=1.045 < EMA20=1.0488, RSI 39.93), 3m BULLISH (price=1.045 > EMA20=1.0435, RSI 54.24). Mixed signals with 1h/15m bearish but 3m bullish. Volume strong (2.76x). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal MEDIUM strength. Potential counter-trend LONG setup (3m bullish vs 1h bearish) but requires high confidence (0.65+). Current confidence moderate due to 1h bearish strength. No position, hold.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4152 < EMA20=0.4172, RSI 43.17), 15m NEUTRAL (price=0.4156 ≈ EMA20=0.4156, RSI 49.41), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4156 > EMA20=0.4152, RSI 53.37). Mixed signals with 1h bearish but 3m bullish. Volume normal (0.57x). Existing SHORT position with small loss (-0.324). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal MEDIUM strength against SHORT position. Since 1h trend remains bearish and reversal is only medium, hold position. Invalidation not triggered (1h price < EMA20).\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.97 < EMA20=13.0718, RSI 38.85), 15m NEUTRAL (price=13.01 ≈ EMA20=13.0102, RSI 48.20), 3m BULLISH (price=13.01 > EMA20=12.9874, RSI 58.22). Mixed signals with 1h bearish but 3m bullish. Volume normal (0.62x). Existing SHORT position with small loss (-0.485). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal MEDIUM strength against SHORT position. Since 1h trend remains bearish and reversal is only medium, hold position. Invalidation not triggered (1h price < EMA20).\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=135.82 < EMA20=136.7506, RSI 39.22), 15m NEUTRAL (price=136.04 ≈ EMA20=135.9926, RSI 49.36), 3m BULLISH (price=136.04 > EMA20=135.8504, RSI 56.83). Mixed signals with 1h bearish but 3m bullish. Volume weak (0.15x) - DO NOT TRADE per hard rule (volume ratio <= 0.20x is hard rule, 0.15x is below threshold). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal MEDIUM strength. No clear edge due to low volume, hold.\n\nPOSITION_SLOTS: 3 open positions (1 LONG, 2 SHORT), 2 available slots. LONG slots available: 1, SHORT slots available: 0. Cannot open new SHORT positions. Global regime bearish (strength 0.83). No cooldowns active. Volume rules critical: DOGE and SOL have weak volume, avoid trades. No high-confidence counter-trend setups identified. Best to hold existing positions and wait for clearer signals.",

Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE - do not force LONG trades unless LOW/MEDIUM risk with high confidence. No cooldowns active. Volume is weak across most coins (ratio <0.5x), reducing confidence. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversals for all coins, but strengths are INFORMATIONAL or MEDIUM, not STRONG. For existing positions, reversal signals are against position direction for XRP (long, 3m bearish reversal INFORMATIONAL), ADA (short, 3m bullish reversal MEDIUM), LINK (short, 3m bullish reversal MEDIUM).

All timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume (ratio 0.53x). Existing LONG position with slight unrealized loss (-$0.05). No reversal signals. Hold position with invalidation if 1h closes below EMA20.\n\nDOGE: 1h bearish (price=0.14862 < EMA20=0.1490, RSI 45.3), 15m neutral (price=0.14861 ≈ EMA20=0.1484, RSI 52.6), 3m bullish (price=0.14862 > EMA20=0.1484, RSI 58.1). Mixed signals with 3m reversal against 1h trend. Volume normal (ratio 1.27x). No position. Counter-trend LONG possible but requires high confidence; current setup lacks strong momentum alignment. Hold.\n\nASTER: 1h bearish (price=1.045 < EMA20=1.0695, RSI 34.3), 15m bearish (price=1.046 < EMA20=1.0485, RSI 41.6), 3m bullish (price=1.045 > EMA20=1.0441, RSI 53.3). 3m reversal against 1h trend with weak volume (ratio 0.27x). Counter-trend LONG setup but volume below 0.5x threshold reduces confidence significantly. Skip trade due to low volume.\n\nADA: 1h bearish (price=0.4157 < EMA20=0.4172, RSI 44.3), 15m neutral (price=0.4161 ≈ EMA20=0.4156, RSI 51.2), 3m bullish (price=0.4157 > EMA20=0.4154, RSI 53.6). 3m reversal against 1h trend with very weak volume (ratio 0.04x). Existing SHORT position with unrealized loss (-$0.35). Volume below 0.20x hard rule prohibits new trades. Hold position with invalidation if 1h closes above EMA20.\n\nLINK: 1h bearish (price=12.99 < EMA20=13.0737, RSI 40.8), 15m bearish (price=13.00 < EMA20=13.0084, RSI 46.6), 3m neutral (price=12.99 ≈ EMA20=12.99, RSI 49.9). 3m reversal with weak volume (ratio 0.36x). Existing SHORT position with unrealized loss (-$0.24). Volume below 0.50x reduces confidence.

Counter-trend LONG setup with moderate confidence. Short slots full (0 available), so cannot open SHORT.

No cooldowns active. Volume constraints block trades on ASTER, ADA, LINK. Counter-trend opportunities on DOGE and SOL, but SOL short slots full and DOGE lacks high confidence.

Global regime is bearish (strength 0.83), with 5 bearish and 1 neutral coins. Position slots: 1 long used (XRP), 1 long slot available, 2 short slots available. Cooldowns: ADA and LINK in coin cooldown (no trades allowed). Volume ratios mostly weak (<0.5x), reducing confidence. Reversal signals show medium 3m reversals for DOGE, ASTER, SOL (against bearish htf), but no strong htf reversals. XRP position is slightly negative (-0.08 PnL) but no reversal signals; hold unless invalidation. For new entries, prioritize trend-following shorts in bearish regimes or counter-trend longs only with high confidence and volume support. Avoid forcing trades due to weak volume and cooldowns.\n\nXRP: 1h bullish (price=2.2029 > EMA20=2.2002, RSI 51.8), 15m neutral (price=2.2027 ≈ EMA20=2.2025, RSI 50.2), 3m neutral (price=2.2025 ≈ EMA20=2.2020, RSI 50.9).

Mixed signals: 1h bearish vs. 3m bullish with medium reversal strength. Weak volume (ratio 0.50x). Counter-trend LONG possible but requires high confidence; current signals not strong enough. Hold.\n\nASTER: 1h bearish (price=1.045 < EMA20=1.0695, RSI 34.3), 15m bearish (price=1.046 < EMA20=1.0485, RSI 41.6), 3m bullish (price=1.045 > EMA20=1.0444, RSI 52.1). Mixed: 1h+15m bearish vs. 3m bullish with medium reversal. Weak volume (ratio 0.39x). Counter-trend LONG possible but low confidence due to weak volume and bearish regime. Hold.\n\nADA: 1h bearish (price=0.4157 < EMA20=0.4172, RSI 44.3), 15m neutral (price=0.4161 ≈ EMA20=0.4156, RSI 51.2), 3m neutral (price=0.4151 ≈ EMA20=0.4153, RSI 47.5).

Hold position but monitor closely.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.14838 < EMA20=0.14893, RSI 43.5), 15m BEARISH (price=0.14838 < EMA20=0.14838, RSI 49.3), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.14838 ≈ EMA20=0.14841, RSI 49.5). All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (ratio 0.041x). Strong trend-following SHORT setup. Confidence 0.65 due to weak volume. Target 0.144, stop 0.152 based on ATR.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.046 < EMA20=1.0674, RSI 34.9), 15m BEARISH (price=1.046 < EMA20=1.0483, RSI 41.6), 3m BULLISH (price=1.046 > EMA20=1.0447, RSI 55.0). Mixed signals: 1h/15m bearish vs 3m bullish. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal (MEDIUM strength) with MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Volume ratio 0.032x (WEAK) indicates low conviction. No clear edge; hold.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4148 < EMA20=0.4169, RSI 42.5), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4148 < EMA20=0.4154, RSI 46.8), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4148 < EMA20=0.4152, RSI 45.1). All timeframes aligned bearish with volume ratio 0.105x (WEAK). Strong trend-following SHORT setup. Confidence 0.65 due to weak volume. Target 0.405, stop 0.422 based on ATR.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.99 < EMA20=13.0657, RSI 40.8), 15m BEARISH (price=12.99 < EMA20=13.0058, RSI 45.0), 3m NEUTRAL (price=12.99 ≈ EMA20=12.9915, RSI 49.3). All timeframes bearish/neutral with very weak volume (ratio 0.008x). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL). Volume below 0.20x threshold; DO NOT TRADE per hard rule.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=135.94 < EMA20=136.6811, RSI 40.4), 15m BEARISH (price=135.94 < EMA20=135.9797, RSI 48.1), 3m NEUTRAL (price=135.94 ≈ EMA20=135.9514, RSI 50.1). All timeframes bearish/neutral with weak volume (ratio 0.036x). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL). Volume below 0.20x threshold; DO NOT TRADE per hard rule.\n\nPOSITION_SLOTS: 1 LONG used (XRP), 1 LONG slot available, 2 SHORT slots available. No cooldowns active. ENHANCED_CONTEXT shows global bearish regime (strength 0.83), short performance poor (net PnL -0.43, 2 losses), but no cooldown. DOGE and ADA offer best SHORT opportunities with aligned bearish trends and acceptable confidence. LINK and SOL volume too low to trade.",

All timeframes aligned bullish with no reversal signals. Volume ratio 0.043x (WEAK) is concerning but not below 0.20x threshold. Position is slightly negative PnL but thesis intact. HOLD.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.14838 < EMA20=0.14893, RSI 43.5), 15m BULLISH (price=0.14885 > EMA20=0.14846, RSI 55.8), 3m BULLISH (price=0.14885 > EMA20=0.14861, RSI 60.3). Mixed signals: 1h bearish vs 15m/3m bullish. This is a potential counter-trend LONG setup. However, volume ratio 0.016x is below 0.20x threshold - DO NOT TRADE per hard rule. HOLD.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.046 < EMA20=1.0674, RSI 34.9), 15m BEARISH (price=1.047 < EMA20=1.0484, RSI 43.8), 3m BULLISH (price=1.047 > EMA20=1.0461, RSI 54.2). Mixed signals with 3m reversal against 1h trend. Volume ratio 0.162x is above 0.20x but still weak. No clear edge for new position. HOLD.\n\nADA: Has existing SHORT position. 1h BEARISH (price=0.4148 < EMA20=0.4169, RSI 42.5), 15m NEUTRAL (price=0.4157 ≈ EMA20=0.4156, RSI 50.0), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4157 > EMA20=0.4155, RSI 52.3). Position has negative PnL with 3m reversal signal (MEDIUM strength). However, 1h trend remains bearish and invalidation condition not met. Volume ratio 0.131x is weak but above threshold. Continue monitoring, HOLD for now.\n\nLINK: Has existing LONG position. 1h BEARISH (price=12.99 < EMA20=13.0657, RSI 40.8), 15m NEUTRAL (price=13.02 ≈ EMA20=13.0097, RSI 50.5), 3m BULLISH (price=13.02 > EMA20=13.0054, RSI 56.8). Position has positive PnL but concerning 1h reversal signal and 3m reversal. Volume ratio 0.011x is critically low (below 0.20x). Consider closing due to weak volume and reversal signals, but position is profitable. HOLD but monitor closely.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=135.94 < EMA20=136.6811, RSI 40.4), 15m BULLISH (price=136.24 > EMA20=136.0381, RSI 52.1), 3m BULLISH (price=136.24 > EMA20=136.1087, RSI 57.1). Mixed signals: 1h bearish vs 15m/3m bullish. Volume ratio 1.066x is NORMAL. This is a potential counter-trend LONG setup. However, long_slots_available is 0 (LONG_FULL constraint), so cannot open new LONG. HOLD.\n\nOverall: Global regime bearish (strength 0.83). LONG slots full (0 available), SHORT slots available (1). No high-confidence setups justify forcing trades in opposite direction. Multiple coins show weak volume. Best approach is to HOLD existing positions and wait for better opportunities.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=2.1997 < EMA20=2.19996, RSI=50.29), 15m BEARISH (price=2.1997 < EMA20=2.20187, RSI=47.25), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2063 > EMA20=2.20272, RSI=61.0). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish with weak volume (ratio=0.067). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM against 1h bearish trend, indicating potential counter-trend LONG opportunity. However, volume is weak (0.067x average), reducing confidence. POSITION_SLOTS allow LONG entries (2 available). No position exists. Confidence low due to volume and mixed timeframes. HOLD.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.14866 < EMA20=0.14893, RSI=45.70), 15m BEARISH (price=0.14865 < EMA20=0.14850, RSI=52.79), 3m BULLISH (price=0.14905 > EMA20=0.14876, RSI=63.78). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish with weak volume (ratio=0.148). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM against 1h bearish trend, indicating potential counter-trend LONG opportunity. Volume is weak (0.148x average), reducing confidence. POSITION_SLOTS allow LONG entries (2 available). No position exists. Confidence low due to volume and mixed timeframes. HOLD.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.042 < EMA20=1.06454, RSI=33.90), 15m BEARISH (price=1.042 < EMA20=1.04662, RSI=38.91), 3m BEARISH (price=1.042 < EMA20=1.04377, RSI=43.53). All timeframes aligned bearish with very weak volume (ratio=0.020). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows no reversal signals. Strong trend-following SHORT setup, but POSITION_SLOTS have SHORT slots full (0 available), so cannot enter SHORT. No counter-trend signal to invalidate trend-following, but slots constraint prevents entry. HOLD.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4144 < EMA20=0.41665, RSI=41.63), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4144 < EMA20=0.41530, RSI=45.40), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4158 > EMA20=0.41525, RSI=55.14). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish with weak volume (ratio=0.056). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM against 1h bearish trend, indicating potential counter-trend LONG opportunity. Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL=-0.193. Reversal signal suggests closing SHORT, but PnL is negative and thesis not invalidated (1h price=0.4144 < EMA20=0.41665). Volume weak, confidence low for new LONG. HOLD position.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=13.01 < EMA20=13.06215, RSI=42.77), 15m BEARISH (price=13.01 < EMA20=13.00908, RSI=48.76), 3m BULLISH (price=13.07 > EMA20=13.02407, RSI=65.20). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish with very weak volume (ratio=0.0055). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM against 1h bearish trend, indicating potential counter-trend LONG opportunity. Volume extremely weak (0.0055x average), violating hard rule (volume ratio <=0.20x). DO NOT TRADE. HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=135.93 < EMA20=136.61044, RSI=40.33), 15m BEARISH (price=135.93 < EMA20=136.01171, RSI=47.73), 3m BULLISH (price=136.33 > EMA20=136.11387, RSI=58.66). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish with weak volume (ratio=0.222). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM against 1h bearish trend, indicating potential counter-trend LONG opportunity. Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL=-0.352. Reversal signal suggests closing SHORT, but PnL is negative and thesis not invalidated (1h price=135.93 < EMA20=136.61044). Volume weak, confidence low for new LONG. HOLD position.\n\nOverall: Market regime bearish, short performance poor (net PnL=-0.714), but no cooldowns active. Volume weak across all coins, limiting trade opportunities. POSITION_SLOTS: SHORT full (0 available), LONG available (2 slots). No high-confidence setups due to volume and mixed timeframes. Maintain discipline; hold cash when no clear edge.",
