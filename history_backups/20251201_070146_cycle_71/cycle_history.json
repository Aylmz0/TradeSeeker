    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish with all coins in BEARISH market regime. Position slots: short slots full (2 used, 0 available), long slots available (2). Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE, so only propose LONG entries if LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence; do not force SHORT entries. Counter-trade analysis is empty, so no explicit counter-trend opportunities. Trend reversal data shows mostly INFORMATIONAL 3m reversals, but these are for existing positions; for entries, focus on alignment. Volume: LINK and SOL have weak volume (ratio <0.5x), so avoid trades per rules. Cooldowns: none active. Existing positions: XRP and ADA in SHORT, both with positive unrealized PnL, no strong reversal signals against them (strength INFORMATIONAL), so hold.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=2.0353 < EMA20=2.139, RSI=20.5 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=2.0356 < EMA20=2.0725, RSI=19.1 oversold), 3m BEARISH (price=2.0353 < EMA20=2.04, RSI=33.3). All timeframes aligned bearish, volume normal. SHORT slots full, so cannot open new SHORT. For LONG, this is counter-trend (opposite to 1h trend). Counter-trend requires risk_level from analysis, but empty; based on data: 1h bearish, 15m+3m bearish, no alignment for LONG, so risk_level likely HIGH_RISK. Do not trade LONG. Hold existing SHORT.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13696 < EMA20=0.1448, RSI=16.3 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13727 < EMA20=0.1395, RSI=21.1 oversold), 3m BEARISH (price=0.13695 < EMA20=0.1373, RSI=37.4). All aligned bearish, volume normal. SHORT slots full, cannot open SHORT. For LONG counter-trend: 1h bearish, 15m+3m bearish, no alignment, risk_level HIGH_RISK. Do not trade.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.001 < EMA20=1.0405, RSI=29.2), 15m BEARISH (price=1 < EMA20=1.0093, RSI=34.1), 3m BULLISH (price=1 > EMA20=0.9979, RSI=55.0). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. For SHORT: trend-following but slots full. For LONG: counter-trend with 3m bullish alignment. Risk_level from reversal data: MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK with 3m reversal strength MEDIUM (but this is for existing positions; for entry, evaluate). 15m+3m not aligned (15m bearish, 3m bullish), so risk_level MEDIUM_RISK at best. Confidence low due to mixed signals. Volume normal. Since SHORT slots full, consider LONG if LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence; confidence estimated 0.5, below min 0.4 but not high enough for counter-trend (needs >0.65). Do not trade.\n\nADA: Existing SHORT position. 1h BEARISH (price=0.3841 < EMA20=0.4081, RSI=19.2 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3845 < EMA20=0.3925, RSI=23.0 oversold), 3m BEARISH (price=0.3841 < EMA20=0.3852, RSI=37.4). All aligned bearish, volume strong. Reversal signals: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL, loss risk LOW. Hold SHORT.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.09 < EMA20=12.8005, RSI=18.8 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=12.1 < EMA20=12.345, RSI=21.5 oversold), 3m BEARISH (price=12.09 < EMA20=12.1175, RSI=38.8). All aligned bearish, but volume ratio=0.316 (WEAK, <0.5x). Per rules: low volume caution, reduce confidence significantly; do not trade due to weak volume. SHORT slots full anyway.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.45 < EMA20=133.2475, RSI=20.5 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=126.57 < EMA20=128.6228, RSI=21.7 oversold), 3m BEARISH (price=126.44 < EMA20=126.7349, RSI=36.7). All aligned bearish, volume ratio=0.412 (WEAK, <0.5x). Low volume caution, reduce confidence; do not trade. SHORT slots full.\n\nOverall: No new entries due to slot constraints and volume issues.

All timeframes aligned bearish, but volume ratio=0.49x (WEAK) reduces confidence. No reversal signals (3m reversal=INFORMATIONAL, not strong). Trend-following SHORT setup, but volume caution. Short slots available=1, so SHORT entry possible. Confidence moderate due to low volume.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13721 < EMA20=0.1440, RSI=18.54), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13721 < EMA20=0.1393, RSI=24.30), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.13721 ≈ EMA20=0.1372, RSI=46.91). Timeframes mostly bearish, but 3m shows indecision. Volume ratio=0.43x (WEAK). No strong reversal signals. Trend-following SHORT setup, but 3m alignment weak. Short slots available=1. Confidence low due to mixed signals and low volume.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.001 < EMA20=1.0367, RSI=29.24), 15m BEARISH (price=1.001 < EMA20=1.0085, RSI=35.37), 3m BULLISH (price=1.001 > EMA20=0.9987, RSI=56.35). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, but 3m bullish. This is a counter-trade opportunity (LONG based on 3m direction). Risk_level from reversal data: MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK (strength=MEDIUM). According to rules, MEDIUM_RISK counter-trade requires confidence >0.65. Volume ratio=0.17x (WEAK, below 0.20x hard rule), so DO NOT TRADE. No entry.\n\nADA: Existing SHORT position. 1h BEARISH (price=0.385 < EMA20=0.4059, RSI=20.62), 15m BEARISH (price=0.385 < EMA20=0.3917, RSI=25.27), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.385 ≈ EMA20=0.3850, RSI=46.47). Position is in line with 1h trend. Reversal signals: 3m reversal=INFORMATIONAL (strength=INFORMATIONAL), which is weak. According to exit logic, do not exit on weak 3m reversals alone. Volume ratio=0.48x (WEAK). Hold position, monitor for stronger reversal.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.7384, RSI=20.40), 15m BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.3254, RSI=24.33), 3m NEUTRAL (price=12.13 > EMA20=12.1174, RSI=50.34). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m slightly bullish. Volume ratio=0.61x (NORMAL). Reversal signals: 3m reversal=MEDIUM (strength=MEDIUM). This could indicate a counter-trade LONG opportunity, but risk_level=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Confidence not high enough (>0.65) given mixed timeframes. No entry.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.47 < EMA20=132.596, RSI=20.92), 15m BEARISH (price=126.46 < EMA20=128.4005, RSI=22.12), 3m BEARISH (price=126.47 < EMA20=126.6543, RSI=40.43). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.85x (NORMAL). No reversal signals. Trend-following SHORT setup. Short slots available=1. Confidence high due to alignment and normal volume.\n\nConstraints: Total open positions=1 (ADA SHORT), max_positions=4, long_slots_available=2, short_slots_available=1. No cooldowns. Global regime bearish. Short performance has been profitable (3 wins, 0 losses).\n\nDecision: Prioritize SOL SHORT as strongest setup. XRP and DOGE SHORT setups weaker due to volume. ASTER and LINK counter-trades invalid due to volume or confidence. Hold ADA. Maintain discipline; no forced trades.",

All three timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume (ratio=0.51). Open Interest high at 231M, funding slightly positive. TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL strength but LOW_LOSS_RISK. Strong trend-following SHORT setup, but SHORT slots are FULL (0 available). Cannot open new SHORT. No counter-trade analysis provided.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13721 < EMA20=0.14403, RSI=18.54), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13721 < EMA20=0.13929, RSI=24.30), 3m BEARISH (price=0.13697 < EMA20=0.13720, RSI=40.94). All three timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume (ratio=0.54). Open Interest very high at 1.34B, funding negative. TREND_REVERSAL shows no reversal signals. Strong trend-following SHORT setup, but SHORT slots are FULL (0 available). Cannot open new SHORT.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.001 < EMA20=1.0367, RSI=29.24), 15m BEARISH (price=1.001 < EMA20=1.0085, RSI=35.37), 3m BULLISH (price=1.003 > EMA20=0.9991, RSI=60.14). Mixed signals: 1h+15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume normal (ratio=0.87). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal MEDIUM strength with MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK, current_trend_3m=BULLISH. This suggests a counter-trend LONG opportunity (3m bullish vs 1h bearish). Risk_level from reversal data is MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK, which corresponds to MEDIUM_RISK in counter-trend rules. Confidence threshold for counter-trend is 0.65. 3m shows strong bullish momentum (RSI=60.14, MACD positive). However, SHORT slots are FULL, LONG slots available=2. According to constraints, if SHORT slots are full, I can only open LONG if it's LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence. This is MEDIUM_RISK, so I need confidence > 0.65. 3m alignment is strong, but 15m+1h are bearish, reducing confidence. Estimated confidence ~0.60, below threshold. Do NOT trade.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.385 < EMA20=0.4059, RSI=20.62), 15m BEARISH (price=0.385 < EMA20=0.3917, RSI=25.27), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.3851 ≈ EMA20=0.3850, RSI=47.57). Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL=-0.2007. TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal MEDIUM strength with MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK, current_trend_3m=BULLISH. This is a reversal warning against my SHORT position. According to exit_logic, MEDIUM strength (only 3m shows reversal) means continue monitoring, don't overreact. 1h trend remains bearish, and invalidation condition (1h price closes above 1h EMA20) not met. Hold position.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.7384, RSI=20.40), 15m BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.3254, RSI=24.33), 3m NEUTRAL/BULLISH (price=12.13 > EMA20=12.1178, RSI=50.53). Mixed signals: 1h+15m bearish, 3m slightly bullish. Volume normal (ratio=0.50). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal MEDIUM strength with MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK, current_trend_3m=BULLISH. Similar to ASTER, counter-trend LONG opportunity. Risk_level=MEDIUM_RISK. 3m shows price > EMA20 and RSI=50.53, but momentum weak. Confidence likely < 0.65. SHORT slots full, so only open LONG if LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence. Not met. Hold.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.47 < EMA20=132.5960, RSI=20.92), 15m BEARISH (price=126.46 < EMA20=128.4005, RSI=22.12), 3m BEARISH (price=126.29 < EMA20=126.6015, RSI=35.30). All three timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume (ratio=0.81). Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL=-0.0372. TREND_REVERSAL shows no reversal signals. Strong trend-following SHORT setup, but position already open. Invalidation condition (1h price closes above 1h EMA20) not met. Hold position.\n\nOverall: Market regime strongly bearish (6/6 coins bearish). SHORT slots are full (2/2 used), LONG slots available=2. No valid counter-trend LONG opportunities meet confidence threshold (>0.65) given MEDIUM_RISK and mixed signals. According to constraints: if SHORT slots full, do NOT force trades in LONG direction unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence. None qualify. Also, if identify valid counter-trend opportunity but cannot execute due to slots full, do NOT open trend-following trade in opposite direction. Here, potential counter-trend LONGs (ASTER, LINK) are not valid due to low confidence, so no conflict. Hold all positions and wait for slots to free up or higher-confidence setups.",

Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.55 (NORMAL). Reversal signal: 3m reversal=MEDIUM with MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Counter-trade analysis empty, but based on rules, counter-trend direction is 15m+3m direction. Here, 15m bearish, 3m bullish, so no clear alignment for counter-trend. Risk level likely HIGH_RISK due to mixed signals. Do not trade.\n\nADA: 1h bearish (price=0.385 < EMA20=0.4059, RSI=20.62), 15m bearish (price=0.3845 < EMA20=0.3905, RSI=26.51), 3m bearish (price=0.3831 < EMA20=0.3844, RSI=40.09). All timeframes bearish, but volume ratio=0.34 (WEAK) reduces confidence. No reversal signals. Trend-following SHORT setup, but weak volume suggests caution. Confidence moderate. Target 0.38, stop 0.39. Invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20.\n\nLINK: 1h bearish (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.7384, RSI=20.40), 15m bearish (price=12.1 < EMA20=12.2847, RSI=22.38), 3m bearish (price=12.06 < EMA20=12.0980, RSI=38.41). All timeframes bearish with volume ratio=0.78 (NORMAL). No reversal signals. Strong trend-following SHORT setup. Confidence high. Target 12.0, stop 12.3. Invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20.\n\nSOL: 1h bearish (price=126.47 < EMA20=132.5960, RSI=20.92), 15m bearish (price=126.32 < EMA20=128.0055, RSI=24.51), 3m bearish (price=126.01 < EMA20=126.2982, RSI=39.60). All timeframes bearish with volume ratio=0.57 (NORMAL). Reversal signal: 3m reversal=INFORMATIONAL, but not strong. Trend-following SHORT setup. Confidence high. Target 125.0, stop 128.0. Invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20.\n\nPosition Slots: total_open=1, short_slots_available=1, long_slots_available=2. Can open up to 3 more positions, but same_direction_limit=2 means max 2 SHORTs. Currently 1 SHORT (DOGE), so can open 1 more SHORT. No LONG setups identified due to bearish regimes.\n\nMarket Regime: Global bearish, all coins bearish. Directional bias: SHORT profitable, LONG not. Cooldowns: none. Counter-trade analysis empty, so no counter-trend opportunities.\n\nDecision: Open SHORTs on XRP, LINK, and SOL as they have strong bearish alignments and volume support. ADA has weak volume, so skip. ASTER mixed, skip. Manage existing DOGE position.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=2.0354 < EMA20=2.1287, RSI=22.16), 15m BEARISH (price=2.0225 < EMA20=2.0565, RSI=21.19), 3m BEARISH (price=2.0225 < EMA20=2.0272, RSI=40.82). All three timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.395 (WEAK) but above 0.20x threshold. Existing SHORT position with -0.0367 PnL. TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal=INFORMATIONAL (only 3m shows reversal against position), but 1h and 15m remain bearish. Continue holding SHORT as 1h trend intact. Invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20 (2.1287).\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13721 < EMA20=0.1440, RSI=18.54), 15m BEARISH (price=0.137 < EMA20=0.1387, RSI=24.68), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.137 ≈ EMA20=0.1370, RSI=47.44). 1h and 15m bearish, 3m neutral. Volume ratio=0.264 (WEAK) but above 0.20x. Existing SHORT position with -0.351416 PnL. TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal=INFORMATIONAL. Continue holding SHORT as 1h trend intact.

Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.190 (WEAK, close to 0.20x threshold). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal=INFORMATIONAL with current_trend_3m=BULLISH. This could be a counter-trend LONG opportunity (3m bullish vs 1h bearish). However, COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS is empty, so no explicit risk_level. Volume is weak (0.190x), reducing confidence. POSITION_SLOTS shows short_slots_available=0 (SHORT_FULL), long_slots_available=2. A counter-trend LONG would be valid directionally, but weak volume and lack of counter-trade analysis make it MEDIUM_RISK at best. Given constraint_instruction: 'If a direction is FULL, do NOT force trades in the other direction unless they are LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK (High Confidence alone is NOT enough).' This setup is not LOW_RISK (no strong confluence), so HOLD.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.385 < EMA20=0.4059, RSI=20.62), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3837 < EMA20=0.3897, RSI=26.27), 3m BEARISH (price=0.3837 < EMA20=0.3843, RSI=44.38). All three timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.140 (WEAK, below 0.20x threshold). Hard rule: DO NOT TRADE if volume ratio <= 0.20x. Volume=0.140x, so skip. HOLD.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.7384, RSI=20.40), 15m BEARISH (price=12.06 < EMA20=12.259, RSI=21.92), 3m BEARISH (price=12.06 < EMA20=12.0903, RSI=39.67). All three timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.251 (WEAK) but above 0.20x. POSITION_SLOTS shows short_slots_available=0 (SHORT_FULL). Cannot open new SHORT. No counter-trend signal (3m bearish). HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.47 < EMA20=132.596, RSI=20.92), 15m BEARISH (price=126.1 < EMA20=127.7965, RSI=24.55), 3m BEARISH (price=126.1 < EMA20=126.2536, RSI=42.76).

No counter-trend signal (3m bearish). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal=INFORMATIONAL, but irrelevant for new entries. HOLD.\n\nOverall: Global regime BEARISH (bearish_count=6). POSITION_SLOTS: short_slots_used=2 (full), long_slots_available=2. Existing SHORT positions in XRP and DOGE are slightly negative but within stop losses. No compelling new entries due to slot constraints or weak volume. Maintain discipline: holding cash is valid when no clear edge exists.",

Do NOT trade.\n\nOverall: Global regime BEARISH (6 bearish, 0 bullish). Position slots: SHORT_FULL (2 shorts open, 0 short slots available, 2 long slots available). Volume is WEAK across all coins (ratios 0.21-0.42), below 0.50x threshold, reducing confidence significantly. No clear high-confidence setups. Existing short positions (XRP, DOGE) show 3m reversals against them (MEDIUM strength), but 1h trends remain bearish, so hold unless invalidation conditions met. No new entries due to slot constraints and volume weakness.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing, incorporating constraints and risk management.\n\nGlobal Regime: Bearish (6 bearish coins, 0 bullish). Market strongly favors SHORT positions, but must respect slot limits.\n\nPosition Slots: SHORT slots full (2 used, 0 available), LONG slots available (2). Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE. Cannot open new SHORTs. Can open LONGs only if LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence. Counter-trend signals (LONG) may be valid, but trend-following SHORTs are invalidated if counter-trend exists.\n\nTrend Reversal Data: For existing SHORT positions (XRP, DOGE), 3m reversal signals with MEDIUM strength. This indicates momentum moving against positions (3m bullish). According to exit logic, MEDIUM reversal (only 3m) suggests monitoring but not overreacting. However, both positions have negative PnL (-0.60% and -0.72%), and system has HARD MARGIN STOP LOSS at 3-7% loss. Current losses are below 1%, but reversal signals warrant caution. Invalidation conditions: XRP if 1h price closes above 1h EMA20 (2.1287), DOGE if 1h price closes above 1h EMA20 (0.1440). Current prices are below these levels, so positions not invalidated yet.\n\nCounter-Trade Analysis: Empty, so no explicit counter-trade opportunities provided.\n\nCooldown Status: No cooldowns active, all directions and coins available for new trades.\n\nVolume Rules: Check volume ratios. ADA has volume_ratio=0.48 (WEAK), below 0.50x, reducing confidence. Others have NORMAL volume (ratio >0.50). Hard rule: if volume ratio <=0.20x, DO NOT TRADE; none violate this.\n\nAnalysis per coin:\n- XRP: 1h bearish (price=2.0304 < EMA20=2.1282, RSI=20.25 oversold), 15m bearish (price=2.0225 < EMA20=2.0565, RSI=21.19 oversold), 3m bullish (price=2.0304 > EMA20=2.0279, RSI=50.63 neutral). 3m reversal against SHORT position. Volume normal. SHORT slots full, cannot open new SHORT. For LONG, counter-trend opportunity: 3m bullish, but 1h and 15m bearish, so risk_level likely HIGH_RISK (weak signal). Confidence low. Hold.\n- DOGE: Similar to XRP. 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m bullish with reversal against SHORT. Volume normal. SHORT slots full. LONG counter-trend: risk_level HIGH_RISK. Hold.\n- ASTER: 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m bearish (price=1 < EMA20=1.0023, RSI=46.29 neutral). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume normal. Strong trend-following SHORT setup, but SHORT slots full. Cannot open SHORT. LONG not supported. Hold.\n- ADA: 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m bullish (price=0.3847 > EMA20=0.3844, RSI=50.70 neutral). Volume weak (ratio=0.48), reducing confidence. SHORT slots full. LONG counter-trend: 3m bullish but 1h/15m bearish, risk_level HIGH_RISK, plus low volume caution. Do not trade.\n- LINK: 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m bullish (price=12.1 > EMA20=12.0943, RSI=49.71 neutral). Volume normal. SHORT slots full. LONG counter-trend: risk_level HIGH_RISK. Hold.\n- SOL: 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m bullish (price=126.35 > EMA20=126.2746, RSI=50.12 neutral). Volume normal. SHORT slots full. LONG counter-trend: risk_level HIGH_RISK. Hold.\n\nOverall, no valid new entries due to SHORT slots full and LONG opportunities having HIGH_RISK (counter-trend with weak signals). Existing positions have MEDIUM reversal signals but not invalidated; monitor closely. Discipline: Do not force trades; holding cash is valid.\n\nConfidence thresholds: min_confidence=0.4. For new trades, confidence would be low (<0.4) for all potential LONGs due to risk_level HIGH_RISK and volume issues.\n\nExit considerations: For XRP and DOGE, reversal signals MEDIUM, but PnL negative. Could consider closing if losses approach 3% or invalidation triggers, but currently not met. Continue holding with stops.\n\nDecision: HOLD all, no new entries.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=2.0372 < EMA20=2.1194, RSI=23.5 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=2.0372 < EMA20=2.0552, RSI=32.6), 3m BULLISH (price=2.0373 > EMA20=2.0288, RSI=58.2). Mixed signals: 1h+15m bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.70x (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM (against 1h bearish trend). This is a counter-trend LONG opportunity (3m bullish vs 1h bearish). However, XRP is in cooldown (coin_cooldowns: XRP=1) - MUST NOT propose trades. Also, short direction is in cooldown (directional_cooldowns: short=3), but LONG is not. Position slots: long_slots_available=2, short_slots_available=1. Since XRP in cooldown, HOLD.\n\nDOGE: Has existing SHORT position (unrealized PnL=-0.924). 1h BEARISH (price=0.1375 < EMA20=0.1434, RSI=20.2 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.1375 < EMA20=0.1386, RSI=30.4), 3m BULLISH (price=0.1375 > EMA20=0.1371, RSI=56.8). Mixed: 1h+15m bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.28x (WEAK - below 0.50x threshold, reduce confidence). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM against position (short). Reversal warning applies: 3m reversal against short position with MEDIUM strength. According to exit_logic, for MEDIUM reversal (only 3m shows reversal), continue monitoring, don't overreact. However, PnL is negative (-0.924) and volume weak. Consider closing if thesis invalidated. Invalidation condition: 'If 1h price closes above 1h EMA20 (0.1440)' - current price=0.1375, still below. But weak volume and negative PnL suggest caution. Since short direction is in cooldown (3 consecutive losses), cannot open new shorts. For existing position, monitor.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.999 < EMA20=1.0327, RSI=29.2), 15m BEARISH (price=0.999 < EMA20=1.0061, RSI=38.3), 3m BEARISH (price=0.999 < EMA20=1.0013, RSI=45.6). All three timeframes aligned BEARISH. Volume ratio=0.83x (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows no reversal signals. This is a trend-following SHORT setup. However, short direction is in cooldown (directional_cooldowns: short=3) - MUST NOT propose new SHORT trades. Also, check counter-trade analysis: empty, no counter-trend signal. Since cannot short due to cooldown, HOLD.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.4040, RSI=22.4 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.3894, RSI=33.5), 3m BULLISH (price=0.3859 > EMA20=0.3846, RSI=58.5). Mixed: 1h+15m bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.58x (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM (against 1h bearish trend). This is a counter-trend LONG opportunity. Check risk_level: Not provided in COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS (empty). According to strategy, counter-trend requires confidence >0.65. 3m bullish with RSI=58.5, but 1h strongly bearish. Confidence moderate. Short direction in cooldown, but LONG is not. Position slots: long_slots_available=2. Could consider LONG if confidence high enough. However, without explicit risk_level, cautious. Volume normal but not strong. HOLD for now.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.677, RSI=21.5 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.2493, RSI=30.8), 3m BULLISH (price=12.14 > EMA20=12.0986, RSI=57.6). Mixed: 1h+15m bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.87x (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM (against 1h bearish trend). Counter-trend LONG opportunity. Similar to ADA. Short direction in cooldown, LONG available. But confidence? 3m RSI=57.6, but 1h RSI=21.5 very oversold - potential for bounce. However, no strong volume spike. HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.38 < EMA20=131.973, RSI=21.7 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=126.38 < EMA20=127.6624, RSI=28.4), 3m BULLISH (price=126.38 > EMA20=126.2569, RSI=51.6). Mixed: 1h+15m bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.65x (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM (against 1h bearish trend). Counter-trend LONG opportunity. Short direction in cooldown, LONG available. 3m RSI=51.6 neutral, not strong. HOLD.\n\nOverall: Market regime BEARISH (global_regime: bearish). Short direction in cooldown (3 consecutive losses) - cannot open new SHORTs. Long direction available but most coins show mixed signals with 3m bullish reversals against 1h bearish trends. However, confidence levels moderate due to lack of strong volume or alignment. XRP in coin cooldown. DOGE has existing short position with negative PnL; monitor but not exit yet as invalidation condition not met. Position slots: 1 short used (DOGE), 3 available slots total. Discipline: Do not force trades. Holding cash is valid.",

All timeframes bearish. Volume ratio=0.448x (WEAK but >0.20x). Strong bearish alignment. SHORT cooldown=1 (3 consecutive losses), but slots available (short_slots_available=1). However, volume weak and confidence low.\n\nPOSITION_SLOTS: long_slots_available=1, short_slots_available=1, total_open=2. COOLDOWN_STATUS: short cooldown=1 (3 consecutive losses). Market regime: BEARISH (6/6 coins). Volume concerns: All coins have volume ratio ≤0.50x, most ≤0.20x (hard rule violation). No counter-trade analysis provided. Decision: Close weak positions, avoid new entries due to low volume and cooldown constraints.",

Short cooldown=2 (4 consecutive losses in SHORT direction), LONG cooldown=0. Position slots: 4 available (2 LONG, 2 SHORT). No positions open.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=2.0372 < EMA20=2.1194, RSI=23.5 oversold). 15m BEARISH (price=2.0373 < EMA20=2.0552, RSI=32.7 oversold). 3m BULLISH (price=2.0373 > EMA20=2.0309, RSI=57.2). Counter-trade analysis empty. 3m shows bullish momentum against 1h/15m bearish trends. Volume ratio=0.82 (NORMAL). This is a counter-trend LONG setup (15m+3m alignment bullish vs 1h bearish). Risk_level not provided, but 15m+3m alignment with volume support suggests MEDIUM_RISK. Confidence threshold >0.65 required. 3m RSI=57.2 not overbought, MACD positive. However, 1h RSI=23.5 oversold suggests potential bounce. SHORT cooldown=2 means no SHORT entries allowed. LONG slots available=2. Invalidation: 3m price closes below 3m EMA20.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.1375 < EMA20=0.1434, RSI=20.2 oversold). 15m BEARISH (price=0.1371 < EMA20=0.1386, RSI=25.9 oversold). 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.1371 ≈ EMA20=0.1371, RSI=48.2). No alignment across timeframes. Volume ratio=0.64 (NORMAL). No clear edge. HOLD.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.999 < EMA20=1.0327, RSI=29.2 oversold). 15m BEARISH (price=1.001 < EMA20=1.0063, RSI=40.3). 3m NEUTRAL (price=1.001 ≈ EMA20=1.0012, RSI=49.9). Volume ratio=0.13 (WEAK) - below 0.20x threshold, DO NOT TRADE per hard rule. HOLD.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.4040, RSI=22.4 oversold). 15m BEARISH (price=0.3841 < EMA20=0.3893, RSI=28.6 oversold). 3m BEARISH (price=0.3841 < EMA20=0.3845, RSI=46.5). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.65 (NORMAL). Trend-following SHORT setup, but SHORT cooldown=2 prohibits SHORT entries. No counter-trend signal (3m bearish). HOLD.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.677, RSI=21.5 oversold). 15m BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.2493, RSI=30.8 oversold). 3m BULLISH (price=12.13 > EMA20=12.1039, RSI=55.1). Counter-trend LONG setup (15m+3m alignment? 15m bearish, 3m bullish - not aligned). 15m RSI=30.8 oversold but price below EMA20. 3m shows bullish momentum. Volume ratio=0.66 (NORMAL). Risk_level unclear; 15m not aligned with 3m, so confidence lower. SHORT cooldown=2 prohibits SHORT entries.

Counter-trend LONG setup (15m+3m alignment? 15m bearish, 3m bullish - not aligned). Volume ratio=0.56 (NORMAL). Similar to LINK, 15m not aligned with 3m. SHORT cooldown=2 prohibits SHORT entries. HOLD.\n\nDECISION: XRP offers the best counter-trend LONG opportunity with 15m+3m alignment (15m oversold RSI=32.7, 3m bullish RSI=57.2, volume normal). Confidence >0.65 required; estimated confidence=0.68 based on alignment and volume. SHORT cooldown prevents other trend-following SHORTs. Other coins have weak or no signals.

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing.\n\nXRP: I have an existing LONG position with unrealized PnL -0.20026. 1h BEARISH (price=2.0372 < EMA20=2.1194, RSI=23.5 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=2.0338 < EMA20=2.0531, RSI=31.3 oversold), 3m BULLISH (price=2.0337 > EMA20=2.0311, RSI=52.7 neutral). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows htf_reversal=true, 3m_reversal=true, strength=MEDIUM, loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. This indicates a counter-trend LONG (since 1h bearish, but 3m bullish). However, risk_level is not explicitly provided in COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS (empty), so I must assess based on reversal signals. Since htf_reversal=true and 3m_reversal=true, this suggests a potential reversal against my LONG position. According to exit_logic, for existing positions, if reversal_signals show STRONG (15m+3m both reversal) or MEDIUM (3m reversal), consider closing if PnL negative. Here, strength=MEDIUM (3m reversal), and PnL is negative (-0.20026), so I should close the position. Invalidation condition from position is 'If 3m price closes below 3m EMA20 (2.0309)'. Current 3m price=2.0337 > EMA20=2.0311, but reversal signals suggest momentum moving against. Volume ratio=1.13 (NORMAL). Given negative PnL and reversal signals, I will close to limit losses.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13746 < EMA20=0.1434, RSI=20.2 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13715 < EMA20=0.1384, RSI=26.9 oversold), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.13715 ≈ EMA20=0.1371, RSI=50.1 neutral). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m_reversal=true, strength=MEDIUM, loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. This suggests a potential counter-trade opportunity (LONG since 3m bullish reversal). However, COOLDOWN_STATUS shows short cooldown=1 (SHORT direction in cooldown), but LONG is not in cooldown. POSITION_SLOTS: long_slots_available=1, short_slots_available=2. Volume ratio=3.56 (STRONG). Since 1h and 15m bearish, but 3m shows reversal, this could be a counter-trend LONG. But risk_level is not provided; based on reversal signals, it's MEDIUM risk. According to counter_trend rules, if risk_level is MEDIUM_RISK, execute if confidence > 0.65. I need to calculate confidence: 3m alignment (price ≈ EMA20, RSI neutral) gives weak signal; volume strong but overall trend bearish. Confidence likely below 0.65. Also, market regime globally bearish. I will HOLD.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.999 < EMA20=1.0327, RSI=29.2 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=1.002 < EMA20=1.0059, RSI=41.3 neutral), 3m NEUTRAL (price=1.001 ≈ EMA20=1.0012, RSI=49.7 neutral). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows no reversal signals, loss_risk_signal=NONE. Volume ratio=0.42 (WEAK, but above 0.20x threshold). No clear edge; all timeframes bearish or neutral. HOLD.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.4040, RSI=22.4 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3844 < EMA20=0.3888, RSI=29.0 oversold), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.3845 ≈ EMA20=0.3845, RSI=49.0 neutral). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m_reversal=true, strength=INFORMATIONAL, loss_risk_signal=LOW_LOSS_RISK. This suggests a weak counter-trade signal. Volume ratio=0.42 (WEAK, but above 0.20x). According to counter_trend rules, INFORMATIONAL strength is for exit_logic only, not for entries. So no trade. HOLD.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.6770, RSI=21.5 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=12.15 < EMA20=12.2407, RSI=33.1 oversold), 3m BULLISH (price=12.15 > EMA20=12.1091, RSI=58.5 bullish). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m_reversal=true, strength=MEDIUM, loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. This indicates a counter-trend LONG opportunity. Volume ratio=1.15 (NORMAL). COOLDOWN_STATUS: no coin cooldowns. POSITION_SLOTS: long_slots_available=1. Confidence: 3m bullish alignment (price > EMA20, RSI >50), but 1h and 15m bearish. Risk_level not provided; based on reversal signals, MEDIUM risk. According to counter_trend rules, if risk_level is MEDIUM_RISK, execute if confidence > 0.65. I estimate confidence around 0.6 due to bearish higher timeframes. Also, market regime bearish. I will HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.38 < EMA20=131.9730, RSI=21.7 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=126.5 < EMA20=127.5638, RSI=30.1 oversold), 3m BULLISH (price=126.5 > EMA20=126.3162, RSI=54.3 bullish). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m_reversal=true, strength=MEDIUM, loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. This indicates a counter-trend LONG opportunity. Volume ratio=2.06 (STRONG). COOLDOWN_STATUS: no coin cooldowns. POSITION_SLOTS: long_slots_available=1. Confidence: 3m bullish alignment with strong volume, but 1h and 15m bearish. Risk_level not provided; based on reversal signals, MEDIUM risk. According to counter_trend rules, if risk_level is MEDIUM_RISK, execute if confidence > 0.65. I estimate confidence around 0.65-0.7 due to strong volume and oversold conditions. However, market regime bearish and short cooldown active (but this is for SHORT direction, not LONG). I will consider a LONG entry with caution. Profit target and stop loss based on ATR: 1h ATR=1.406, so target ~128.0, stop ~125.0. Invalidation if 3m price closes below 3m EMA20.\n\nOverall, I will close XRP position due to negative PnL and reversal signals. For SOL, a counter-trend LONG is valid with medium confidence. Other coins have no clear edge. Ensure not to exceed position slots: after closing XRP, long_slots_available will be 1 (since XRP is long), so I can open SOL LONG.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish with all coins in bearish market regimes. Position slots: 1 long used (SOL), 1 long slot available, 2 short slots available. No cooldowns active. Volume is weak across all coins (ratio <=0.5x), reducing confidence and cautioning against trades per rules. Analyze each coin:\n\nXRP: 1h bearish (price=2.0372 < EMA20=2.1194, RSI=23.5 oversold), 15m bearish (price=2.0338 < EMA20=2.0531, RSI=31.3 oversold), 3m bearish (price=2.0298 < EMA20=2.0309, RSI=48.0 neutral). All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (ratio=0.30x). No counter-trade analysis provided. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength INFORMATIONAL but no position. Edge: Strong trend-following SHORT setup, but volume weak reduces confidence. Invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20.\n\nDOGE: 1h bearish (price=0.13746 < EMA20=0.1434, RSI=20.2 oversold), 15m bearish (price=0.13715 < EMA20=0.1384, RSI=26.9 oversold), 3m bearish (price=0.13681 < EMA20=0.1371, RSI=42.8 neutral). All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (ratio=0.21x). No reversal signals. Edge: Strong trend-following SHORT setup, but volume weak reduces confidence. Invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20.\n\nASTER: 1h bearish (price=0.999 < EMA20=1.0327, RSI=29.2 oversold), 15m bearish (price=1.002 < EMA20=1.0059, RSI=41.3 neutral), 3m bearish (price=1 < EMA20=1.0012, RSI=47.2 neutral). All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (ratio=0.18x). No reversal signals. Edge: Trend-following SHORT setup, but volume very weak and price near EMA20 on 3m reduces edge. Invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20.\n\nADA: 1h bearish (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.4040, RSI=22.4 oversold), 15m bearish (price=0.3844 < EMA20=0.3888, RSI=29.0 oversold), 3m bearish (price=0.3836 < EMA20=0.3844, RSI=43.0 neutral). All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (ratio=0.29x). No reversal signals. Edge: Strong trend-following SHORT setup, but volume weak reduces confidence. Invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20.\n\nLINK: 1h bearish (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.6770, RSI=21.5 oversold), 15m bearish (price=12.15 < EMA20=12.2407, RSI=33.1 oversold), 3m bullish (price=12.16 > EMA20=12.1175, RSI=60.3 bullish). Timeframes mixed: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish with weak volume (ratio=0.04x). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength MEDIUM and current_trend_3m BULLISH, indicating potential counter-trend LONG opportunity. However, volume ratio=0.04x is <=0.20x, triggering hard rule: DO NOT TRADE due to weakness warning. Risk level cannot be assessed as counter-trade analysis empty, but volume invalidates any trade. Edge: No trade due to volume rule.\n\nSOL: Existing LONG position with unrealized PnL -0.31268933. 1h bearish (price=126.38 < EMA20=131.9730, RSI=21.7 oversold), 15m bearish (price=126.5 < EMA20=127.5638, RSI=30.1 oversold), 3m bearish (price=126.24 < EMA20=126.2945, RSI=47.7 neutral). All timeframes aligned bearish against position. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows htf_reversal true and 3m_reversal true with strength INFORMATIONAL, but reversal warnings apply only to existing positions. Current position is losing, and thesis invalidated as 3m price is below EMA20 (126.24 < 126.3162 per exit plan). Volume weak (ratio=0.11x). Edge: Close position due to invalidation and bearish alignment.\n\nOverall: Market bearish, volume weak across board, reducing confidence for new entries. Best SHORT setups on XRP, DOGE, ADA, but volume caution applies. LINK has counter-trend signal but volume too low. SOL position should be closed. Adhere to position slots: 1 long slot available, 2 short slots available. No trades on LINK due to volume rule. Prioritize closing SOL.",

POSITION_SLOTS: SHORT slots full (0 available), LONG slots available=2. Current SHORT position has -0.32 PnL. Since SHORT slots full, cannot open new SHORT. 3m bullish reversal suggests potential LONG counter-trend, but need to check constraints.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.1375 < EMA20=0.1434, RSI=20.2), 15m BEARISH (price=0.1368 < EMA20=0.1384, RSI=25.1), 3m BEARISH (price=0.1368 < EMA20=0.1370, RSI=41.9). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.52x (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows no reversal signals. Current SHORT position has +0.07 PnL. SHORT slots full, cannot open new SHORT. No counter-trend LONG signal.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.999 < EMA20=1.0327, RSI=29.2), 15m BEARISH (price=0.998 < EMA20=1.0056, RSI=38.6), 3m BEARISH (price=0.998 < EMA20=1.0004, RSI=44.7). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=1.15x (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows no reversal signals. No position. SHORT slots full, cannot open new SHORT.

All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=5.45x (STRONG bearish volume). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows no reversal signals. No position. SHORT slots full, cannot open new SHORT. No counter-trend LONG signal.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.677, RSI=21.5), 15m BEARISH (price=12.15 < EMA20=12.2407, RSI=33.1), 3m BULLISH (price=12.15 > EMA20=12.1234, RSI=57.6). Mixed signals: 1h+15m bearish but 3m bullish. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM. Volume ratio=0.08x (WEAK - below 0.20x threshold). Volume weakness warning: DO NOT TRADE due to volume ratio <= 0.20x. No position.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.38 < EMA20=131.973, RSI=21.7), 15m BEARISH (price=126.32 < EMA20=127.5466, RSI=29.1), 3m BULLISH (price=126.32 > EMA20=126.2994, RSI=49.9). Mixed signals: 1h+15m bearish but 3m bullish. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM. Volume ratio=0.93x (NORMAL). No position. SHORT slots full, cannot open new SHORT. 3m bullish reversal suggests potential LONG counter-trend.\n\nPOSITION_SLOTS CONSTRAINT: SHORT slots full (0 available), LONG slots available=2. Constraint mode: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE. Instruction: If a direction is FULL, do NOT force trades in the other direction unless they are LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK (High Confidence alone is NOT enough). For counter-trend opportunities (LONG) when SHORT slots full, must NOT open trend-following SHORT trades.\n\nCOUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS: Empty, so no explicit counter-trade risk levels.\n\nMARKET REGIME: Global regime BEARISH (6 bearish, 0 bullish).\n\nDECISION LOGIC: For XRP and SOL, 3m bullish reversals suggest potential LONG counter-trend setups. Need to evaluate risk_level per counter-trade rules. Since COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS is empty, I must assess based on data: 3m alignment + volume/RSI. For XRP: 3m bullish (price>EMA20, RSI=52.3), volume normal. For SOL: 3m bullish (price>EMA20, RSI=49.9), volume normal. Both have 15m bearish, so not strong confluence. Risk_level likely MEDIUM_RISK (Tier 2: 3m alignment + volume normal). Confidence threshold for counter-trend: 0.65. Need confidence > 0.65 to execute. For LINK: volume ratio 0.08x, below 0.20x threshold - HARD RULE: DO NOT TRADE.\n\nEXISTING POSITIONS: XRP SHORT has -0.32 PnL with 3m reversal MEDIUM strength. Per exit_logic: STRONG reversal if 15m+3m both show reversal; here only 3m shows reversal, so MEDIUM strength. Action: Continue monitoring, don't overreact to noise. DOGE SHORT has +0.07 PnL, no reversal signals.\n\nFINAL: SHORT slots full, so no new SHORT entries. For LONG counter-trend: XRP and SOL have MEDIUM_RISK setups. Need confidence > 0.65. XRP: 3m bullish but 1h+15m bearish, RSI=52.3 (neutral), volume normal. Confidence estimated 0.60 (below threshold). SOL: Similar, confidence estimated 0.60. LINK: volume weak, skip. ADA, DOGE, ASTER: no LONG signals. Therefore, no new LONG entries. Hold existing positions and cash.",

Do not trade.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.38 < EMA20=131.9730, RSI 21.7), 15m BEARISH (price=126.34 < EMA20=127.4352, RSI 29.2), 3m BULLISH (price=126.63 > EMA20=126.3508, RSI 57.9). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength MEDIUM. Volume ratio 0.47x (WEAK). No position. Since short_slots_available=0, cannot open new shorts. Long slots available=2, but 1h trend bearish, so counter-trend LONG possible. Check risk: 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m bullish—partial alignment (3m only). Risk level likely HIGH_RISK per counter-trade rules (requires 15m+3m alignment for LOW_RISK). Confidence low. Volume weak. Do not trade.\n\nOverall: Global regime bearish, short slots full, long slots available but no strong counter-trend setups. Volume weak across most coins. Discipline: Hold existing positions, avoid forcing trades.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish with all coins in BEARISH market regime. Position slots: 1 short position open (DOGE), with short_slots_available=1, long_slots_available=2, total available_slots=3. Cooldowns: XRP in coin cooldown (1 cycle), no directional cooldowns. Counter-trade analysis is empty, indicating no strong counter-trend opportunities. Trend reversal data shows 3m reversals for XRP, DOGE, LINK, SOL with strength MEDIUM, but these apply only to existing positions; DOGE has a short position with 3m reversal MEDIUM, suggesting monitoring but not exiting on weak signals. Volume analysis: XRP volume_ratio=1.75 (STRONG), DOGE=0.55 (NORMAL), ASTER=0.39 (WEAK), ADA=0.26 (WEAK), LINK=0.62 (NORMAL), SOL=1.11 (NORMAL). Weak volume (<=0.20x) rule: no coins violate, but ASTER and ADA have WEAK volume, reducing confidence. Directional performance: short has profitability_index=24.2 but caution_active=true due to consecutive losses; long has lower profitability. Constraints: avoid trades in XRP due to cooldown; do not force trades if slots full; maintain discipline.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=2.0372 < EMA20=2.1194, RSI=23.5 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=2.0337 < EMA20=2.0512, RSI=31.2), 3m BULLISH (price=2.0423 > EMA20=2.0335, RSI=62.8). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish with strong volume. However, XRP in cooldown, so HOLD.\n\nDOGE: Existing short position with unrealized PnL=-0.25476. 1h BEARISH (price=0.13746 < EMA20=0.1434, RSI=20.2 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13678 < EMA20=0.1382, RSI=25.1), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.13705 ≈ EMA20=0.1370, RSI=50.4). Trend reversal: 3m reversal MEDIUM against short position, but strength MEDIUM suggests continue monitoring, not exit. Volume normal. Keep position with invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20=0.1434.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.999 < EMA20=1.0327, RSI=29.2 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.998 < EMA20=1.0049, RSI=38.5), 3m BEARISH (price=0.999 < EMA20=0.9999, RSI=47.8). All timeframes aligned bearish, but volume weak (0.39x), reducing confidence. No clear edge, HOLD.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.4040, RSI=22.4 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3827 < EMA20=0.3881, RSI=26.6), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.3838 ≈ EMA20=0.3839, RSI=47.6). Mixed with weak volume (0.26x). No strong setup, HOLD.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.677, RSI=21.5 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=12.15 < EMA20=12.232, RSI=33.1), 3m BULLISH (price=12.17 > EMA20=12.1359, RSI=60.0). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish with normal volume. Trend reversal: 3m reversal MEDIUM, but no position. Could consider counter-trend LONG, but risk_level not provided in counter_trade_analysis, and slots allow. However, confidence moderate due to 1h bearish alignment; avoid.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.38 < EMA20=131.973, RSI=21.7 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=126.34 < EMA20=127.435, RSI=29.2), 3m BULLISH (price=126.64 > EMA20=126.3887, RSI=57.1). Mixed signals similar to LINK. Trend reversal: 3m reversal MEDIUM, no position. Volume normal. No strong edge, HOLD.\n\nOverall, market bearish with limited high-confidence setups. Maintain existing DOGE short; no new entries due to mixed signals, weak volume for some, and cooldown for XRP.",

Timeframes conflict: 1h+15m bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.82x (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM (against 1h bearish trend). This is a counter-trade opportunity (LONG direction). Risk_level not provided in COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS, but 3m alignment with volume suggests MEDIUM_RISK. Confidence moderate due to 1h bearish pressure.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13746 < EMA20=0.1434, RSI=20.2 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13719 < EMA20=0.1382, RSI=30.3), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.13716 ≈ EMA20=0.1371, RSI=52.8). EXISTING SHORT position with unrealized PnL=-0.38214. TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM (current_trend_3m=BULLISH). This suggests potential reversal against short position. Volume ratio=0.91x (NORMAL). Consider closing if reversal strengthens, but 1h+15m still bearish. Monitor closely.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.999 < EMA20=1.0327, RSI=29.2), 15m BEARISH (price=1 < EMA20=1.0045, RSI=40.8), 3m NEUTRAL (price=1 ≈ EMA20=0.9999, RSI=50.0). Timeframes mostly bearish. Volume ratio=0.56x (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM. No clear edge; skipping.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3859 < EMA20=0.4040, RSI=22.4 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.384 < EMA20=0.3878, RSI=30.8), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.3841 ≈ EMA20=0.3839, RSI=50.4). Timeframes bearish. Volume ratio=0.56x (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM. No clear edge; skipping.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.6770, RSI=21.5 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=12.19 < EMA20=12.2298, RSI=37.9), 3m BULLISH (price=12.16 > EMA20=12.1446, RSI=55.8). Timeframes conflict: 1h+15m bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio=1.08x (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM. Similar to XRP, counter-trade opportunity (LONG). Confidence moderate.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.38 < EMA20=131.973, RSI=21.7 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=126.72 < EMA20=127.3998, RSI=34.1), 3m BULLISH (price=126.71 > EMA20=126.4777, RSI=58.3). Timeframes conflict: 1h+15m bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.95x (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM. Counter-trade opportunity (LONG). Confidence moderate.\n\nPOSITION_SLOTS: total_open=1, long_slots_available=2, short_slots_available=1. Can open up to 2 LONGs and 1 SHORT. DOGE is existing SHORT (1 slot used).\n\nGLOBAL_REGIME: bearish (all coins BEARISH on 1h). ENHANCED_CONTEXT shows short performance poor (net_pnl=-2.20, profitability_index=24.2), but no cooldown. DIRECTIONAL_BIAS shows short caution_active=true but consecutive_losses=1 (<3).\n\nDecision: XRP, LINK, SOL show counter-trade LONG opportunities (3m bullish vs 1h bearish). Choose best with volume support. XRP volume ratio=0.82x, LINK=1.08x, SOL=0.95x. LINK has highest volume ratio, but all NORMAL. LINK also has strongest 3m bullish signal (RSI=55.8, MACD positive). Execute LINK LONG as highest confidence counter-trade. Close DOGE SHORT if reversal risk increases, but currently 1h bearish holds; hold with stop-loss. Others: hold.",

POSITION SLOTS: total_open=2, max_positions=4, short_slots_available=0, long_slots_available=2. CONSTRAINT: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE - 'If a direction is FULL, do NOT force trades in the other direction unless they are LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK (High Confidence alone is NOT enough).' No counter-trade analysis provided, so cannot assess counter-trend opportunities. All coins show WEAK volume (ratio <=0.28x), violating volume rules. COOLDOWN_STATUS: No cooldowns active. PERFORMANCE: Both long and short have negative net PnL, but no cooldowns. DECISION: Hold existing positions (DOGE short, ADA short). No new entries due to volume weakness and slot constraints.",
