    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish with all coins in bearish market regime. Position slots: 2 open positions (both SHORTs: DOGE and ADA), short slots full (0 available), long slots available (2). Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE, so do NOT force LONG trades unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence. Counter-trade analysis is empty, but trend reversal data indicates some 3m reversals. Volume ratios are normal (>0.20x), no low volume issues. Cooldowns: none active. Risk: total return -3.77%, but no margin used, available cash $72.36.\n\nXRP: 1h bearish (price=2.0457 < EMA20=2.1132, RSI=26.99), 15m bearish (price=2.0457 < EMA20=2.0512, RSI=39.94), 3m bullish (price=2.0433 > EMA20=2.0402, RSI=56.99). 3m reversal strength MEDIUM against 1h trend. Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish - mixed signals. Volume ratio 0.67x normal. No position. Since short slots full, cannot open SHORT. For LONG: counter-trend opportunity (3m bullish vs 1h bearish), but risk from reversal data is MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. According to strategy, counter-trend requires confidence >0.65 and risk_level not HIGH_RISK or VERY_HIGH_RISK. Here, risk_level is MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK (from trend reversal data), which is acceptable if confidence high. However, 3m bullish but RSI 56.99 not overbought, MACD positive, but 15m bearish momentum weakens edge. Confidence estimated 0.55 (below 0.65 threshold). Also, constraint says do not force LONG unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK; this is MEDIUM_RISK, but confidence insufficient. Decision: HOLD.\n\nDOGE: 1h bearish (price=0.13693 < EMA20=0.1427, RSI=17.67), 15m bearish (price=0.13693 < EMA20=0.1380, RSI=28.55), 3m bearish (price=0.1369 < EMA20=0.1370, RSI=45.36).

Invalidation: 1h price closes above EMA20=0.1434. Current price 0.1369, still below EMA20. No strong reversal signals; continue holding. Decision: HOLD.\n\nASTER: 1h bearish (price=0.999 < EMA20=1.0296, RSI=29.56), 15m bearish (price=0.999 < EMA20=1.0039, RSI=40.00), 3m bearish (price=1.0 ≈ EMA20=1.0000, RSI=49.68). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 0.67x normal. 3m reversal strength INFORMATIONAL, loss risk LOW_LOSS_RISK. No position. Since short slots full, cannot open SHORT.

All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 0.56x normal. No reversal signals. No position. Since short slots full, cannot open SHORT. For LONG: counter-trend not applicable as 3m is bearish (not bullish). No edge.

Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish - mixed signals. Volume ratio 1.09x normal. No position. Since short slots full, cannot open SHORT. For LONG: counter-trend opportunity (3m bullish vs 1h bearish), risk from reversal data is MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. 3m bullish with RSI 51.99, MACD positive, but 15m bearish. Confidence estimated 0.60 (below 0.65 threshold). Constraint: do not force LONG unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK; this is MEDIUM_RISK, but confidence insufficient. Decision: HOLD.\n\nOverall: No high-confidence setups above 0.65. Short slots full, so no new SHORTs. LONG opportunities exist for XRP and SOL but confidence below threshold.

Volume ratio 0.138x (WEAK) - DO NOT TRADE per hard rule.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.12 < EMA20=12.6231, RSI=20.84). 15m BEARISH (price=12.12 < EMA20=12.2133, RSI=32.34). 3m NEUTRAL (price=12.13 ≈ EMA20=12.1354, RSI=48.94). All timeframes aligned bearish except 3m neutral. Volume ratio 0.414x (WEAK) - DO NOT TRADE per hard rule.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.56 < EMA20=131.4868, RSI=23.42). 15m BEARISH (price=126.57 < EMA20=127.3208, RSI=33.00). 3m NEUTRAL (price=126.52 ≈ EMA20=126.5316, RSI=50.42). All timeframes aligned bearish except 3m neutral. Volume ratio 0.351x (WEAK) - DO NOT TRADE per hard rule.\n\nCONCLUSION: All coins show bearish 1h and 15m trends, but 3m timeframes are neutral or bearish. CRITICAL ISSUE: Volume ratios are all ≤0.414x (WEAK), with most ≤0.17x. System rules state: 'If volume ratio is <= 0.20x average, DO NOT TRADE. This is a hard rule.' and 'If volume ratio is 0.20-0.50x, reduce confidence significantly.' Given weak volume across all assets, no trades meet minimum confidence threshold. Holding cash is the superior position.",

Global regime is bearish with all coins in bearish market regimes. No positions open, all slots available. Counter-trade analysis is empty, so no explicit counter-trend signals. Volume analysis critical: XRP, DOGE, ADA, LINK have weak volume (ratio <= 0.50x), violating hard rule for XRP (0.21x) and DOGE (0.12x) - DO NOT TRADE these. ASTER has strong volume (2.96x), SOL normal (0.92x). Check alignment: For each coin, 1h bearish (price < EMA20, RSI low). 15m bearish for all. 3m mixed but mostly bearish or neutral. No strong bullish alignments. Evaluate counter-trend opportunities: Since COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS is empty, no risk_level provided, but based on data, check if 15m+3m align opposite to 1h. For XRP: 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m neutral (RSI 50.8, price near EMA20) - no counter-trend alignment. DOGE: Similar, 3m neutral. ASTER: 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m bearish - no counter-trend. ADA: 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m neutral. LINK: 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m neutral. SOL: 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m bullish (price > EMA20, RSI 51.7) - potential counter-trend LONG? But 15m is bearish, so 15m+3m not aligned opposite; 3m alone insufficient for counter-trend per rules (requires 15m+3m alignment). Volume weak for most coins, so only consider ASTER and SOL. ASTER: Strong bearish alignment across timeframes with strong volume - high-confidence SHORT. SOL: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish but volume normal; no strong counter-trend signal; trend-following SHORT supported but 3m shows some bullish momentum, reducing confidence. Risk management: Stop-loss based on 1h ATR. Invalidation conditions explicit. No cooldowns active. Position slots: 2 long and 2 short available. Since global bearish, prioritize SHORTs but avoid weak volume coins. Discipline: Do not force trades; holding cash valid.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=2.0457 < EMA20=2.1132, RSI=26.99), 15m BEARISH (price=2.0407 < EMA20=2.0498, RSI=37.87), 3m BEARISH (price=2.0373 < EMA20=2.0396, RSI=47.48). All three timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.16x (WEAK) - violates volume rule (≤0.20x). Open Interest high but Funding slightly positive. Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL +0.178. No reversal signals. Continue holding SHORT.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13693 < EMA20=0.14274, RSI=17.67), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13694 < EMA20=0.13793, RSI=29.45), 3m BEARISH (price=0.1368 < EMA20=0.13694, RSI=43.22). All three timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.064x (WEAK) - violates volume rule (≤0.20x). Funding negative. Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL -0.041. No reversal signals. Continue holding SHORT.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.999 < EMA20=1.0296, RSI=29.56), 15m BEARISH (price=0.996 < EMA20=1.003, RSI=37.75), 3m BEARISH (price=0.994 < EMA20=0.9982, RSI=34.88). All three timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.075x (WEAK) - violates volume rule (≤0.20x). Funding slightly positive. No position. Volume too weak for new entry.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3834 < EMA20=0.4018, RSI=19.30), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3832 < EMA20=0.3869, RSI=30.97), 3m BEARISH (price=0.3828 < EMA20=0.3832, RSI=43.23). All three timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.044x (WEAK) - violates volume rule (≤0.20x). Funding negative. No position. Volume too weak for new entry.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.12 < EMA20=12.6231, RSI=20.84), 15m BEARISH (price=12.16 < EMA20=12.2099, RSI=37.31), 3m BULLISH (price=12.15 > EMA20=12.1394, RSI=53.60). 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish - mixed signals. Volume ratio=0.204x (WEAK but >0.20x threshold). Funding negative. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal=TRUE (strength=INFORMATIONAL) with LOW_LOSS_RISK. This suggests potential counter-trend LONG opportunity. However, POSITION_SLOTS shows short_slots_available=0 (SHORT_FULL), long_slots_available=2. Counter-trend LONG would be valid if risk_level is LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. Analysis: 3m bullish alignment with price>EMA20 and RSI>50, but volume weak and 1h/15m bearish. This is MEDIUM_RISK at best (not LOW_RISK). According to constraints: 'If a direction is FULL, do NOT force trades in the other direction unless they are LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK (High Confidence alone is NOT enough).' MEDIUM_RISK is allowed, but confidence must be >0.65. Given weak volume and mixed signals, confidence would be ~0.55. Also, counter-trade_analysis is empty, so no explicit risk_level. Safer to HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.56 < EMA20=131.4868, RSI=23.42), 15m BEARISH (price=126.58 < EMA20=127.2502, RSI=33.15), 3m BULLISH (price=126.55 > EMA20=126.5343, RSI=51.39). 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish - mixed signals. Volume ratio=0.263x (WEAK but >0.20x threshold). Funding negative. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal=TRUE (strength=INFORMATIONAL) with LOW_LOSS_RISK. Similar to LINK: potential counter-trend LONG. POSITION_SLOTS: short_slots_available=0, long_slots_available=2. Analysis: 3m bullish with price>EMA20 and RSI>50, but volume weak and 1h/15m bearish. MEDIUM_RISK at best. Confidence ~0.55. No explicit counter-trade_analysis. HOLD.\n\nOverall: Global regime BEARISH. Two existing SHORT positions (XRP, DOGE). Short slots full (2/2), long slots available (2). Volume is weak across all coins (≤0.20x for XRP, DOGE, ASTER, ADA; >0.20x but still WEAK for LINK, SOL). Volume rule: 'If volume ratio is <= 0.20x average, DO NOT TRADE. This is a hard rule.' This blocks new entries for XRP, DOGE, ASTER, ADA. For LINK and SOL, volume ratio >0.20x, so trading is allowed if other conditions met. However, mixed signals and MEDIUM_RISK counter-trend setups with confidence <0.65 suggest HOLD. No cooldowns active. Maintain discipline: do not force trades.",

Volume ratio=1.13 (NORMAL). No position. SHORT slots full, cannot open new SHORTs. For counter-trend LONG: 3m neutral, not bullish enough. No trade.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.12 < EMA20=12.6231, RSI=20.84), 15m BEARISH (price=12.18 < EMA20=12.2118, RSI=39.60), 3m BULLISH (price=12.18 > EMA20=12.1435, RSI=59.98). Mixed signals. Volume ratio=0.39 (WEAK). Volume ratio 0.39 is below 0.50x, reducing confidence significantly. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal (strength=MEDIUM). SHORT slots full. For counter-trend LONG: 3m bullish but 15m bearish + weak volume = not strong enough. No trade.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.56 < EMA20=131.4868, RSI=23.42), 15m BEARISH (price=126.72 < EMA20=127.2636, RSI=35.21), 3m BULLISH (price=126.72 > EMA20=126.5491, RSI=57.32). Mixed signals. Volume ratio=1.06 (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal (strength=INFORMATIONAL). SHORT slots full. For counter-trend LONG: 3m bullish but 15m bearish, not strong enough alignment. No trade.\n\nOverall: Global regime BEARISH (6/6 coins bearish). POSITION_SLOTS: SHORT slots full (0 available), LONG slots available=2. Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE. According to constraint_instruction: 'If a direction is FULL, do NOT force trades in the other direction unless they are LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK (High Confidence alone is NOT enough).' For LONG entries (counter-trend in bearish market), need LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK per counter_trade_analysis rules. COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS is empty, so no explicit risk levels. Evaluating each coin for counter-trend LONG: None show strong 15m+3m alignment (required for LOW_RISK). Most have 3m bullish but 15m bearish, which would be MEDIUM_RISK at best, but confidence would be low due to 1h bearish trend. With min_confidence=0.4, none reach that for LONG. Therefore, no new entries. Hold existing positions. Monitor reversals but don't exit on weak signals.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing.\n\nGLOBAL CONTEXT: Market regime is BEARISH (6/6 coins bearish, strength=1). Position slots: 4 available (2 long, 2 short). No cooldowns active. Short performance has been poor (-1.71 PnL, 2 losses), but no cooldown triggered. Counter-trade analysis is empty, so no explicit counter-trade signals.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=2.0457 < EMA20=2.1132, RSI=26.99). 15m BEARISH (price=2.0447 < EMA20=2.0495, RSI=40.68). 3m BULLISH (price=2.0494 > EMA20=2.0419, RSI=63.04). Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. This is a counter-trend LONG setup (3m bullish vs 1h bearish). Volume ratio=1.08 (NORMAL). No counter-trade risk level provided, so must assess manually. 3m shows strong momentum (RSI 63, MACD positive), but 1h trend is firmly bearish. Confidence moderate due to 3m strength but against 1h trend. Risk level estimated as MEDIUM_RISK (3m alignment + volume support). Since risk_level is not HIGH_RISK or VERY_HIGH_RISK, trade is allowed per rules. Direction: LONG (counter-trend). Invalidation: if 3m price closes below 3m EMA20.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13693 < EMA20=0.14274, RSI=17.67). 15m BEARISH (price=0.13721 < EMA20=0.13787, RSI=33.37). 3m BULLISH (price=0.13751 > EMA20=0.13709, RSI=63.47). Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Counter-trend LONG setup. Volume ratio=1.84 (STRONG). 3m momentum strong (RSI 63, MACD positive). Risk level estimated as MEDIUM_RISK. Trade allowed. Direction: LONG. Invalidation: if 3m price closes below 3m EMA20.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.999 < EMA20=1.0296, RSI=29.56). 15m BEARISH (price=0.999 < EMA20=1.0026, RSI=41.48). 3m BULLISH (price=1.001 > EMA20=0.9984, RSI=56.05). Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Counter-trend LONG setup. Volume ratio=1.00 (NORMAL). 3m momentum moderate (RSI 56, MACD slightly negative). Risk level estimated as MEDIUM_RISK. Trade allowed. Direction: LONG. Invalidation: if 3m price closes below 3m EMA20.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3834 < EMA20=0.4018, RSI=19.30). 15m BEARISH (price=0.3834 < EMA20=0.3866, RSI=31.81). 3m BULLISH (price=0.3864 > EMA20=0.3836, RSI=68.12). Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Counter-trend LONG setup. Volume ratio=1.25 (NORMAL). 3m momentum very strong (RSI 68, MACD positive). Risk level estimated as MEDIUM_RISK. Trade allowed. Direction: LONG. Invalidation: if 3m price closes below 3m EMA20.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.12 < EMA20=12.6231, RSI=20.84). 15m BEARISH (price=12.19 < EMA20=12.2097, RSI=40.77). 3m BULLISH (price=12.2 > EMA20=12.16, RSI=60.73). Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Counter-trend LONG setup. Volume ratio=1.63 (STRONG). 3m momentum strong (RSI 61, MACD positive). Risk level estimated as MEDIUM_RISK. Trade allowed. Direction: LONG. Invalidation: if 3m price closes below 3m EMA20.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.56 < EMA20=131.4868, RSI=23.42). 15m BEARISH (price=126.85 < EMA20=127.225, RSI=37.13). 3m BULLISH (price=127.05 > EMA20=126.6769, RSI=65.08). Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Counter-trend LONG setup. Volume ratio=1.84 (STRONG). 3m momentum strong (RSI 65, MACD positive). Risk level estimated as MEDIUM_RISK. Trade allowed. Direction: LONG. Invalidation: if 3m price closes below 3m EMA20.\n\nDECISION RATIONALE: All coins show similar pattern: 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m bullish. This is a counter-trend LONG opportunity across multiple assets. Risk levels are estimated as MEDIUM_RISK (not HIGH_RISK), so trades are allowed per strategy rules. Confidence is moderate (0.6-0.65) due to counter-trend nature but supported by 3m momentum and volume. Position slots allow up to 2 LONGs, but constraint mode is NORMAL: if a direction is full, do not force trades in other direction unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. Here, LONG slots are available (2), and these are MEDIUM_RISK, so can execute. Choose the two strongest setups: DOGE (strongest volume, RSI 63) and SOL (strong volume, RSI 65). Others are similar but slightly weaker. Hold others to avoid overexposure and maintain discipline.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT: Stop-loss based on 1h ATR or swing. Use 1h ATR for conservative stops. Profit target set for at least 1:1.3 risk-reward. Hard margin stop at 3-7% loss will auto-close if hit.",

DOGE volume too weak to trade. SOL LONG position to close due to negative PnL and reversal signals. DOGE LONG position holds as PnL positive and not invalidated. Select best SHORT opportunities: LINK (highest confidence), ADA, ASTER. XRP volume weak reduces confidence. Max simultaneous positions 4, currently 2 (DOGE LONG, SOL LONG). After closing SOL, 1 position. Can open up to 3 new SHORTs within 2 available SHORT slots (same_direction_limit 2). Choose top 2 SHORTs: LINK and ADA.",

Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.91 (NORMAL). No counter-trade analysis provided. Market regime NEUTRAL. No position. Since 1h and 15m bearish, but 3m bullish, this could be a counter-trend LONG opportunity. However, 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM (from TREND_REVERSAL_DATA), and loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. According to counter_trend rules, MEDIUM_RISK requires confidence > 0.65. Analysis: 3m bullish with RSI=69.6 (overbought), MACD positive, but 1h and 15m bearish. Confidence estimated at 0.6 (below threshold). Also, short_slots_available=0, so cannot open SHORT. But for LONG, long_slots_available=1. However, constraint_instruction: If a direction is FULL, do NOT force trades in the other direction unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK (High Confidence alone is NOT enough). Here, SHORT is full, LONG is available. This setup is MEDIUM_RISK but confidence <0.65, so should not force. Also, volume ratio >0.20, okay.

Existing LONG position. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA: htf_reversal=true, 3m_reversal=true, strength=MEDIUM, loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Reversal signals against LONG position (htf and 3m show reversal). According to exit_logic, STRONG reversal if 15m+3m both show reversal; here, 15m_reversal=false, so only 3m reversal=MEDIUM. Action: Consider closing if PnL negative or thesis invalidated. Current unrealized PnL=0.0635 (positive). Invalidation condition: If 3m price closes below 3m EMA20 (0.13709). Current price=0.13757 > EMA20=0.1372, so not invalidated. Volume ratio=0.75 (NORMAL).

Existing SHORT position. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA: 3m_reversal=true, strength=MEDIUM, loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Reversal signals against SHORT position (3m bullish reversal). But 3m price not above EMA20 significantly. Invalidation condition: If 1h price closes above 1h EMA20 (1.0296). Current price=0.999 < 1.0296, so not invalidated. Volume ratio=0.45 (WEAK, but >0.20).

According to exit_logic, consider closing if PnL negative and reversal signals. Here, PnL negative, 3m reversal=MEDIUM. But 15m not showing reversal.

Market regime NEUTRAL. Could be counter-trend LONG, but MEDIUM_RISK requires confidence >0.65. Analysis: 3m bullish with strong volume, but 1h and 15m bearish. Confidence estimated at 0.65 (borderline). short_slots_available=0, so cannot open SHORT. For LONG, long_slots_available=1. Constraint_instruction: If SHORT full, do not force LONG unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. Here, MEDIUM_RISK with confidence=0.65, just meets threshold.

Directional feedback shows short performance poor (net PnL -1.82, profitability index 0), long performance positive (net PnL 0.034, profitability index 100). Cooldown status: short direction has cooldown 2 (after 3 consecutive losses), long direction cooldown 0. Position slots: total open 3, max positions 4, long slots used 2 (0 available), short slots used 1 (1 available), available slots 1. Constraint mode: LONG_FULL_SHORT_AVAILABLE, instruction: do not force trades in other direction unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. Counter-trade analysis is empty, no active counter-trend signals.\n\nXRP: Market regime NEUTRAL. 1h (htf) bearish (price=2.0564 < EMA20=2.1142, RSI 30.46), 15m neutral to bearish (price=2.0535 > EMA20=2.0504 but RSI 46.35, MACD negative), 3m bullish (price=2.0584 > EMA20=2.0480, RSI 71.42, MACD positive). Volume ratio 0.44x (WEAK). Alignment: 1h bearish, 15m mixed, 3m bullish - no clear edge. Reversal signals: 3m reversal true (strength MEDIUM), loss risk MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. No position. Given long slots full and no strong counter-trend signal (risk level not LOW_RISK), hold.\n\nDOGE: Market regime BEARISH. 1h bearish (price=0.13757 < EMA20=0.1428, RSI 21.54), 15m bearish (price=0.13757 < EMA20=0.1379, RSI 38.34, MACD negative), 3m bullish (price=0.13767 > EMA20=0.1373, RSI 63.08, MACD positive). Volume ratio 0.19x (WEAK, below 0.20x hard rule - DO NOT TRADE). Alignment: mixed, but volume weakness invalidates any setup. Reversal signals: htf reversal true, 3m reversal true (strength MEDIUM), loss risk MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Existing LONG position with unrealized PnL positive. Exit logic: reversal signals against position (htf and 3m reversal true, strength MEDIUM) but PnL positive; monitor but no immediate exit. Hold position.\n\nASTER: Market regime BEARISH. 1h bearish (price=0.999 < EMA20=1.0296, RSI 29.56), 15m bearish (price=1.001 < EMA20=1.0026, RSI 43.80, MACD negative), 3m bearish (price=0.998 < EMA20=0.9986, RSI 47.70, MACD negative). Volume ratio 0.066x (WEAK, below 0.20x hard rule - DO NOT TRADE for new entries). Alignment: all timeframes bearish, strong trend-following SHORT setup but volume weak. Reversal signals: 3m reversal true (strength INFORMATIONAL), loss risk LOW_LOSS_RISK. Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL positive. Exit logic: reversal signals informational only, no strong reversal against position. Hold position.\n\nADA: Market regime BEARISH. 1h bearish (price=0.3874 < EMA20=0.4022, RSI 26.68), 15m bearish (price=0.3868 < EMA20=0.3869, RSI 43.15, MACD negative), 3m bullish (price=0.3883 > EMA20=0.3854, RSI 75.14, MACD positive). Volume ratio 0.71x (NORMAL). Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish - potential counter-trend LONG. Reversal signals: 3m reversal true (strength MEDIUM), loss risk MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. No position. Counter-trend analysis: risk level MEDIUM_RISK (from loss risk signal). According to strategy, counter-trend direction is 15m+3m direction (bullish), but risk level MEDIUM_RISK requires confidence > 0.65. Confidence based on alignment: 3m strong (RSI overbought 75.14), but 1h and 15m bearish, volume normal. Estimated confidence 0.6 (below threshold). Also, long slots full, and constraint instruction: do not force trades in other direction unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK (High Confidence alone not enough). Here, risk MEDIUM_RISK but confidence insufficient, so hold.\n\nLINK: Market regime BEARISH. 1h bearish (price=12.19 < EMA20=12.6298, RSI 25.52), 15m bearish (price=12.24 < EMA20=12.2161, RSI 46.07, MACD negative), 3m mixed (price=12.17 < EMA20=12.1804, RSI 49.37, MACD positive). Volume ratio 0.84x (NORMAL). Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m neutral - trend-following SHORT possible. Reversal signals: htf reversal true, loss risk NONE. Existing LONG position with unrealized PnL positive. Exit logic: reversal signals htf reversal true (strength NONE per data), but position is LONG against bearish trend. However, PnL positive and no strong reversal against position (3m reversal false). Hold position.\n\nSOL: Market regime BEARISH. 1h bearish (price=127.33 < EMA20=131.5601, RSI 27.41), 15m bearish (price=127.08 < EMA20=127.2345, RSI 40.42, MACD negative), 3m bullish (price=127.37 > EMA20=126.9395, RSI 71.00, MACD positive). Volume ratio 0.38x (WEAK, below 0.50x caution). Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish - potential counter-trend LONG. Reversal signals: 3m reversal true (strength MEDIUM), loss risk MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. No position. Counter-trend analysis: risk level MEDIUM_RISK. Confidence: 3m strong bullish but volume weak, 1h and 15m bearish. Estimated confidence 0.55. Long slots full, and constraint: do not force trades unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence. Here, risk MEDIUM_RISK but confidence low, so hold.\n\nOverall: No new entries due to slot constraints (long full, short available but no high-confidence setups) and volume weaknesses.

Mixed signals: 1h bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.69x (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal=TRUE (strength=MEDIUM) but no position. No clear edge - HOLD.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13768 < EMA20=0.1423, RSI=22.50), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13768 < EMA20=0.1379, RSI=39.74 < 50), 3m BULLISH (price=0.13768 > EMA20=0.1374, RSI=62.97 > 50). EXISTING LONG position (unrealized PnL=+0.20). TREND_REVERSAL shows htf_reversal=TRUE (strength=MEDIUM) against LONG position. This is a STRONG reversal signal (htf+3m reversal). According to exit_logic: STRONG reversal (15m+3m both show reversal) - consider closing if PnL negative, but PnL is positive. However, 1h trend is bearish and htf_reversal signal suggests risk. Invalidation condition not met (3m price > EMA20). Given reversal strength and bearish regime, CLOSE position to protect gains.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.997 < EMA20=1.0264, RSI=28.95), 15m BEARISH (price=0.997 < EMA20=1.0018, RSI=40.03 < 50), 3m BEARISH (price=0.997 < EMA20=0.9984, RSI=44.66 < 50). EXISTING SHORT position (unrealized PnL=+0.59). All timeframes aligned bearish - strong trend-following SHORT. TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal=TRUE but strength=INFORMATIONAL only.

Mixed signals: 1h bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio=1.08x (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal=TRUE (strength=MEDIUM). Could be counter-trend LONG opportunity (3m bullish vs 1h bearish). Check COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS: empty, so no risk_level. According to counter_trend rules: need confidence > 0.65. 3m alignment + volume normal = MEDIUM_RISK? Actually, without risk_level from counter_trade_analysis, cannot assess. Also, POSITION_SLOTS: long_slots_available=0 (FULL). Constraint: If direction is FULL, do NOT force trades in other direction unless LOW_RISK/MEDIUM_RISK. This is not LOW_RISK (no explicit risk_level). Therefore, CANNOT open LONG. HOLD.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.17 < EMA20=12.5868, RSI=25.45), 15m BEARISH (price=12.17 < EMA20=12.2082, RSI=40.18 < 50), 3m NEUTRAL (price=12.17 < EMA20=12.1820, RSI=48.99 < 50). EXISTING LONG position (unrealized PnL=-0.09). Volume ratio=0.24x (WEAK) - volume weakness warning: if volume ratio <= 0.20x, DO NOT TRADE; 0.24x is low volume caution, reduce confidence. TREND_REVERSAL shows htf_reversal=TRUE (strength=NONE) but loss_risk_signal=NONE. However, 1h and 15m bearish, 3m neutral with weak volume. Position is losing. Invalidation condition not met (1h price < EMA20). But weak volume and bearish trends suggest poor setup. Consider closing due to weak conviction and negative PnL.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=127.19 < EMA20=131.1517, RSI=27.39), 15m BEARISH (price=127.19 < EMA20=127.2595, RSI=42.37 < 50), 3m BULLISH (price=127.18 > EMA20=126.9667, RSI=61.02 > 50). Mixed signals: 1h bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio=1.62x (STRONG). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal=TRUE (strength=MEDIUM). Could be counter-trend LONG opportunity. Check COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS: empty. POSITION_SLOTS: long_slots_available=0 (FULL). Constraint: cannot open LONG. Also, COOLDOWN_STATUS: short cooldown=1 (active) - MUST NOT propose SHORT trades. Therefore, HOLD.\n\nOverall: Global regime BEARISH (6 bearish, 0 bullish). POSITION_SLOTS: total_open=3, max_positions=4, long_slots_used=2 (FULL), short_slots_used=1 (available=1). Available_slots=1. COOLDOWN: short direction in cooldown (3 consecutive losses) - NO SHORT trades allowed. Therefore, only possible new trade is SHORT, but cooldown blocks it. Must manage existing positions.\n\nDecision Rationale: Close DOGE LONG due to STRONG reversal signals (htf+3m reversal) despite positive PnL, to avoid risk in bearish regime. Close LINK LONG due to weak volume, bearish trends, and negative PnL. Hold ASTER SHORT as strong trend-following. Others: no new trades due to slot constraints and cooldown.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=2.0561 < EMA20=2.1087, RSI=30.48, MACD negative). 15m NEUTRAL (price=2.0561 ≈ EMA20=2.0512, RSI=47.91). 3m BULLISH (price=2.0551 > EMA20=2.0493, RSI=64.07, MACD positive). Mixed signals: 1h bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.71 (NORMAL). No clear edge - 1h trend dominant but 3m shows counter-trend momentum. Risk: Counter-trade analysis empty, so no explicit risk_level. Given 1h bearish regime and 3m bullish divergence, this could be a counter-trend LONG opportunity, but without risk_level classification, confidence insufficient (<0.65). HOLD.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13768 < EMA20=0.14233, RSI=22.5, MACD negative). 15m BEARISH (price=0.13768 < EMA20=0.13788, RSI=39.74, MACD negative). 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.13753 ≈ EMA20=0.13737, RSI=57.26). All timeframes bearish or neutral. Volume ratio=0.53 (NORMAL). Strong trend-following SHORT setup with 1h+15m alignment. SHORT signal valid.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.997 < EMA20=1.0264, RSI=28.95, MACD negative). 15m BEARISH (price=0.997 < EMA20=1.0018, RSI=40.03, MACD negative). 3m BEARISH (price=0.995 < EMA20=0.998, RSI=39.45, MACD negative). All timeframes bearish. Volume ratio=1.14 (NORMAL). Strong trend-following SHORT setup with full alignment. SHORT signal valid.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3883 < EMA20=0.40096, RSI=28.5, MACD negative). 15m NEUTRAL (price=0.3883 > EMA20=0.38718, RSI=47.33). 3m BULLISH (price=0.3873 > EMA20=0.38579, RSI=63.61, MACD positive). Mixed signals: 1h bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.38 (WEAK, but >0.20 threshold). Low volume reduces confidence. Similar to XRP, potential counter-trend LONG but insufficient confidence. HOLD.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.17 < EMA20=12.5868, RSI=25.45, MACD negative). 15m BEARISH (price=12.17 < EMA20=12.2082, RSI=40.18, MACD negative). 3m NEUTRAL (price=12.16 ≈ EMA20=12.1799, RSI=46.94). 1h+15m bearish alignment. Volume ratio=0.42 (WEAK, but >0.20). Trend-following SHORT setup valid despite weak volume.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=127.19 < EMA20=131.1517, RSI=27.39, MACD negative). 15m BEARISH (price=127.19 < EMA20=127.2595, RSI=42.37, MACD negative). 3m NEUTRAL (price=127.01 ≈ EMA20=126.9682, RSI=54.28). 1h+15m bearish alignment. Volume ratio=0.92 (NORMAL). Strong trend-following SHORT setup.\n\nPOSITION SLOTS: long_slots_available=2, short_slots_available=2. Can open up to 2 SHORTs without constraint issues.\n\nCOOLDOWN: No directional or coin cooldowns active.\n\nPERFORMANCE CONTEXT: Global regime BEARISH (strength=1). Short performance poor (net PnL=-1.82, profitability_index=0), but no cooldown. Long performance positive but limited data.\n\nDECISION: Focus on high-confidence trend-following SHORTs in bearish regimes: DOGE, ASTER, LINK, SOL. Choose top 2 based on alignment and volume strength: DOGE (full bearish alignment, normal volume) and ASTER (full bearish alignment, normal volume). LINK and SOL have weaker 3m signals or volume. XRP and ADA mixed, no clear edge.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT: Use 1h ATR for stops. Maintain 1:1.3 risk-reward. Hard margin stop at ~3% loss.",

No new entry due to short slots full.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3883 < EMA20=0.4010, RSI=28.50), 15m NEUTRAL (price=0.3878 ≈ EMA20=0.3871, RSI=46.16), 3m BULLISH (price=0.3878 > EMA20=0.3864, RSI=62.26). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM, current_trend_3m=BULLISH. Volume weak (ratio=0.31). Mixed signals: 1h bearish, 3m bullish. Counter-trend LONG possible, but volume weak reduces confidence. Slots: short_slots_available=0, long_slots_available=2. Since short slots full, cannot open SHORT. Counter-trend LONG has MEDIUM risk based on reversal data, but volume weak and confidence below 0.65. HOLD.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.17 < EMA20=12.5868, RSI=25.45), 15m BEARISH (price=12.16 < EMA20=12.2073, RSI=39.45), 3m NEUTRAL (price=12.16 ≈ EMA20=12.1793, RSI=47.04). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows no reversal signals. Volume weak (ratio=0.27). All timeframes bearish or neutral, no clear edge. HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=127.19 < EMA20=131.1517, RSI=27.39), 15m NEUTRAL (price=127.27 ≈ EMA20=127.2672, RSI=43.14), 3m BULLISH (price=127.27 > EMA20=127.0564, RSI=56.91). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM, current_trend_3m=BULLISH. Volume normal (ratio=0.51). Mixed signals: 1h bearish, 3m bullish. Counter-trend LONG possible with better volume than others. Slots: short_slots_available=0, long_slots_available=2. Since short slots full, cannot open SHORT. Counter-trend LONG has MEDIUM risk, but volume supports. Confidence calculated: 3m bullish with RSI 56.91, MACD positive, but 1h bearish. Confidence ~0.55 (below 0.65 threshold for counter-trend). HOLD.\n\nOverall: Global regime bearish, short slots full (2 used), long slots available (2). Constraint: short_slots_available=0, so no SHORT entries. Counter-trend opportunities exist but volume weak or confidence low. Close DOGE position due to reversal risk. Hold others.",

Position slots: 1 short position open (ASTER), 1 short slot available, 2 long slots available. No directional cooldowns. Counter-trade analysis is empty. Trend reversal data shows 3m reversals for XRP (INFORMATIONAL), DOGE (MEDIUM), ADA (MEDIUM), LINK (INFORMATIONAL), SOL (MEDIUM), but these are informational/medium strength and apply to existing positions; no positions exist except ASTER. For entries, prioritize trend-following in bearish regimes but consider counter-trend if risk_level is LOW or MEDIUM and confidence > 0.65. Volume ratios checked: XRP 1.18 (NORMAL), DOGE 0.85 (NORMAL), ASTER 2.68 (STRONG), ADA 0.51 (NORMAL), LINK 0.46 (WEAK but >0.20, caution), SOL 0.61 (NORMAL). LINK volume weak but above 0.20x threshold, reduce confidence. Analyze each coin:\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=2.0561 < EMA20=2.1087, RSI 30.5), 15m NEUTRAL (price=2.056 > EMA20=2.0514, RSI 48.2), 3m BULLISH (price=2.056 > EMA20=2.0512, RSI 60.4). Mixed signals: 1h bearish, 3m bullish. Counter-trade opportunity? 1h bearish, 3m bullish suggests potential LONG counter-trend. Risk_level from trend reversal data: LOW_LOSS_RISK. Volume normal. Open Interest high, funding slightly negative. Confidence for LONG: 0.6 (moderate). But 3m reversal strength INFORMATIONAL, not strong. Prefer trend-following SHORT? 1h bearish aligns with global regime, but 3m bullish weakens edge.

All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume strong. Position unrealized PnL +0.0179. No reversal signals. Continue holding; exit plan: profit target 0.97, stop loss 1.02, invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20 (1.0264).\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3883 < EMA20=0.4010, RSI 28.5), 15m NEUTRAL (price=0.3884 > EMA20=0.3872, RSI 47.9), 3m BULLISH (price=0.3884 > EMA20=0.3865, RSI 65.0). Mixed: 1h bearish, 3m bullish. Counter-trade LONG? Risk_level MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Volume normal. Funding negative. Confidence for LONG: 0.6 (moderate).

Mostly bearish but 3m neutral. Volume weak (0.46x), caution. Funding negative. Confidence low due to volume. No clear edge; hold.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=127.19 < EMA20=131.1517, RSI 27.4), 15m BEARISH (price=127.45 < EMA20=127.2794, RSI 45.7), 3m BULLISH (price=127.45 > EMA20=127.0887, RSI 60.3).

All timeframes aligned bearish, no reversal signals. Volume weak (ratio=0.086, <0.2x, DO NOT TRADE for new entries). Position has unrealized PnL=0.13, stop_loss=12.5, invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20=12.5868. No exit signal; HOLD position.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=127.19 < EMA20=131.1517, RSI=27.4), 15m BEARISH (price=127.29 < EMA20=127.2796, RSI=44.0), 3m BULLISH (price=127.29 > EMA20=127.1852, RSI=55.1). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. 3m reversal=INFORMATIONAL (strength=INFORMATIONAL) with current_trend_3m=BULLISH, suggesting potential counter-trend LONG. Volume ratio=0.151 (WEAK, <0.2x, DO NOT TRADE per hard rule). Short slots full, LONG not viable due to low volume. HOLD.\n\nOverall: Global regime BEARISH, short slots full (short_slots_available=0), long slots available=2. Volume is weak across all coins (ratios <0.2x), triggering hard rule to DO NOT TRADE for new entries. No high-confidence setups. Maintain existing positions (ASTER SHORT, LINK SHORT) as no strong reversal signals warrant exit. Discipline: Holding cash is valid when no clear edge exists.",

Counter-trade analysis empty, but based on rules, counter-trend direction is 15m+3m direction (BULLISH). Risk_level not provided, but confidence from 3m alignment is moderate. However, 1h trend is strong bearish, so counter-trend setup requires high confidence (>0.65). Current confidence estimated 0.6, below threshold. Hold.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.997 < EMA20=1.0264, RSI=28.95), 15m BEARISH (price=0.997 < EMA20=1.0009, RSI=41.56), 3m BULLISH (price=1.002 > EMA20=0.998, RSI=60.18).

TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=INFORMATIONAL, loss_risk_signal=LOW_LOSS_RISK.

COOLDOWN_STATUS: ASTER in cooldown, no directional cooldowns. ENHANCED_CONTEXT: global regime bearish, short performance poor (profitability_index=0), but no cooldown. Risk management: maintain at least 1:1.3 risk-reward, use 1h ATR for stops. Volume rules: skip ADA due to low volume.

Alignment: 1h bearish, 15m neutral, 3m bullish - mixed signals. Volume ratio=0.80x (NORMAL). Reversal signals: 3m reversal=MEDIUM (against 1h bearish trend). Counter-trade analysis empty. No position. Given 1h bearish and 3m bullish, this is a counter-trend LONG opportunity. Risk level from reversal data: MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. According to strategy, counter-trend with MEDIUM_RISK requires confidence >0.65. Confidence based on 3m bullish alignment and volume support is moderate but not strong (RSI 62.43 not overbought). Confidence estimated at 0.60. However, position slots: LONG slots available=0 (full), SHORT slots available=1.

Reversal signals: htf_reversal=true, 3m_reversal=true, strength=MEDIUM, loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. This indicates reversal against LONG position (since 1h bearish and 3m bullish reversal). According to exit logic, reversal strength=MEDIUM (3m reversal against position) suggests continue monitoring, don't overreact. PnL is positive, so no immediate exit needed. Invalidation condition from position: If 3m price closes below 3m EMA20 (0.1379). Current price=0.13826 > EMA20=0.1379, so thesis intact. HOLD.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.002 < EMA20=1.0248, RSI=33.14), 15m NEUTRAL (price=1.002 < EMA20=1.0022, RSI=46.88), 3m BULLISH (price=1.002 > EMA20=1.0015, RSI=52.31). Alignment: 1h bearish, 15m neutral, 3m bullish - mixed. Volume ratio=4.11x (STRONG). Existing LONG position with unrealized PnL=0.0294 positive. Reversal signals: htf_reversal=true, 3m_reversal=true, strength=MEDIUM, loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Similar to DOGE, reversal against LONG position. PnL positive, invalidation condition: If 3m price closes below 3m EMA20 (1.0015). Current price=1.002 > EMA20=1.0015, thesis intact. HOLD.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3881 < EMA20=0.3997, RSI=28.72), 15m NEUTRAL (price=0.3881 > EMA20=0.3874, RSI=47.30), 3m BULLISH (price=0.3881 > EMA20=0.3876, RSI=58.28). Alignment: 1h bearish, 15m neutral, 3m bullish - mixed. Volume ratio=1.19x (NORMAL). Reversal signals: 3m_reversal=true, strength=INFORMATIONAL, loss_risk_signal=LOW_LOSS_RISK. Counter-trend LONG opportunity with LOW_RISK. According to strategy, counter-trend with LOW_RISK is STRONG SIGNAL (Tier 1) and should EXECUTE. Confidence based on 3m bullish alignment and volume support: RSI 58.28 not overbought, price > EMA20. Confidence estimated at 0.70. Position slots: LONG slots available=0 (full), SHORT slots available=1. Constraint instruction: If LONG full, do NOT force trades in other direction unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. This is LOW_RISK, but slots unavailable. According to CRITICAL constraint: If valid counter-trend opportunity (LONG) but slots full, MUST NOT open trend-following trade in opposite direction (SHORT). Simply HOLD. So HOLD.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.19 < EMA20=12.5482, RSI=27.28), 15m BEARISH (price=12.19 < EMA20=12.1975, RSI=43.80), 3m BULLISH (price=12.19 > EMA20=12.1756, RSI=54.25). Alignment: 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m bullish - mixed. Volume ratio=0.83x (NORMAL). Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL=-0.1145 negative. Reversal signals: 3m_reversal=true, strength=INFORMATIONAL, loss_risk_signal=LOW_LOSS_RISK. Reversal against SHORT position (3m bullish). According to exit logic, reversal strength=INFORMATIONAL (only 15m reversal? data shows 15m_reversal=false, so likely 3m only) - prioritize 1h trend. 1h bearish supports SHORT. PnL negative but small. Invalidation condition: If 1h price closes above 1h EMA20 (12.5482). Current price=12.19 < EMA20=12.5482, thesis intact. HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=127.78 < EMA20=130.8762, RSI=30.07), 15m NEUTRAL (price=127.77 > EMA20=127.397, RSI=49.74), 3m BULLISH (price=127.77 > EMA20=127.5029, RSI=64.92). Alignment: 1h bearish, 15m neutral, 3m bullish - mixed. Volume ratio=0.77x (NORMAL). Reversal signals: 3m_reversal=true, strength=MEDIUM, loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Counter-trend LONG opportunity with MEDIUM_RISK. Confidence based on 3m bullish alignment: RSI 64.92 approaching overbought, price > EMA20. Confidence estimated at 0.65 (borderline). Position slots: LONG slots available=0 (full), SHORT slots available=1. Constraint instruction: If LONG full, do NOT force trades in other direction unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. This is MEDIUM_RISK but slots unavailable. Must HOLD.\n\nOverall: Global regime bearish, LONG slots full (2 used), SHORT slots available (1). No new entries possible due to slot constraints. Monitor existing positions for invalidation. All positions have positive or small negative PnL, with invalidation conditions not met. Discipline: Holding cash is valid when no clear edge or slots full.",
