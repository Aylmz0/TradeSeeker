    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. This is cycle 1, so observing unless exceptional setups appear. Position slots: 0/1 used, 2 long and 2 short slots available. No cooldowns active. Global regime is bullish (strength 0.67), but most coins show neutral market regimes. Volume is weak across all coins (ratios 0.07-0.27x), reducing confidence materially as per rules. Counter-trade analysis shows several STRONG counter-trend opportunities (XRP, DOGE, ADA) where 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish align. SOL shows 1h bearish with 15m+3m bearish for trend-following SHORT. LINK has 1h bullish but mixed lower timeframes. ASTER shows mixed signals. Given startup behavior (cycles 1-3: observe unless exceptional setup) and weak volume, I'll be conservative and only take the highest conviction setup.\n\nXRP: 1h bullish (price=2.2169 > EMA20=2.2088, RSI 54.2), but 15m bearish (price=2.2168 < EMA20=2.2185, RSI 50.6), 3m bearish (price=2.2161 < EMA20=2.2182, RSI 42.6). STRONG counter-trend SHORT opportunity per counter-trade analysis, but volume ratio 0.15x (WEAK) reduces confidence. Risk level VERY_HIGH_RISK. Holding due to weak volume and high risk.\n\nDOGE: 1h bullish (price=0.15379 > EMA20=0.15364, RSI 52.0), 15m bearish (price=0.1538 < EMA20=0.1539, RSI 49.8), 3m bearish (price=0.15377 < EMA20=0.15395, RSI 41.1). STRONG counter-trend SHORT opportunity, volume ratio 0.27x (WEAK), risk MEDIUM_RISK. Confidence too low due to weak volume.\n\nASTER: 1h bullish (price=1.097 > EMA20=1.0969, RSI 48.5), 15m bearish (price=1.097 < EMA20=1.0979, RSI 49.3), 3m bullish (price=1.097 > EMA20=1.0965, RSI 49.7). Mixed alignment (MEDIUM strength), volume ratio 0.07x (WEAK), risk HIGH_RISK. No clear edge, holding.\n\nADA: 1h bullish (price=0.4352 > EMA20=0.4330, RSI 56.9), 15m bearish (price=0.4352 < EMA20=0.4355, RSI 51.3), 3m bearish (price=0.4352 < EMA20=0.4362, RSI 39.1). STRONG counter-trend SHORT opportunity, volume ratio 0.23x (WEAK), risk MEDIUM_RISK. Confidence too low due to weak volume.\n\nLINK: 1h bullish (price=13.46 > EMA20=13.4017, RSI 56.7), 15m bearish (price=13.46 < EMA20=13.4625, RSI 51.0), 3m bullish (price=13.46 > EMA20=13.4576, RSI 49.2). Mixed alignment (MEDIUM strength), volume ratio 0.07x (WEAK), risk HIGH_RISK. Bullish market regime but weak volume and mixed signals, holding.\n\nSOL: 1h bearish (price=141.86 < EMA20=142.0235, RSI 50.6), 15m bearish (price=141.86 < EMA20=142.2046, RSI 44.2), 3m bearish (price=141.84 < EMA20=141.9966, RSI 41.3). All timeframes aligned bearish for trend-following SHORT. Volume ratio 0.14x (WEAK) but alignment is strong. Risk VERY_HIGH_RISK per counter-trade, but this is a trend-following (not counter-trend) opportunity. Given strong bearish alignment across 1h, 15m, 3m and neutral market regime, this is the highest conviction setup despite weak volume. Using 1h ATR (1.116) for stop-loss, targeting 1:1.3 risk-reward.",

However, short_slots_available=1, but constraint: if counter-trend valid but cannot execute, do not open trend-following opposite.

Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM alignment strength with MEDIUM_RISK. Volume ratio 1.92x (STRONG) - good conviction. 3m reversal signal is NONE. No position. Strong volume supports trend-following LONG despite 3m bearish momentum. Best candidate for LONG entry.\n\nLINK: 1h BULLISH (price=13.46 > EMA20=13.4017, RSI 56.7), 15m BEARISH (price=13.45 < EMA20=13.4596, RSI 49.4), 3m BEARISH (price=13.41 < EMA20=13.4443, RSI 36.2). Counter-trade analysis shows STRONG alignment strength with LOW_RISK for counter-trend SHORT. Volume ratio 1.78x (STRONG). 3m reversal signal is INFORMATIONAL only. No position. Valid counter-trend SHORT setup (15m+3m BEARISH against 1h BULLISH). Strong volume and LOW_RISK rating make this attractive.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=141.86 < EMA20=142.0235, RSI 50.6), 15m BEARISH (price=142.02 < EMA20=142.1948, RSI 47.0), 3m BEARISH (price=141.53 < EMA20=141.8631, RSI 35.2). Counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.75x (NORMAL). No reversal signals. Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL +0.33. All timeframes aligned BEARISH, supporting hold. Position is profitable; continue with exit plan.\n\nPosition Slots: 1 open (SOL SHORT), 2 LONG slots available, 1 SHORT slot available. LINK counter-trend SHORT is valid and fits available slots. ADA trend-following LONG is best LONG candidate. No cooldowns active. Global regime bullish but mixed per coin.",

Must check for valid counter-trend LONG opportunities.

Counter-trade analysis shows STRONG alignment for SHORT (1h bullish vs 15m+3m bearish), but volume ratio 0.40x (WEAK) reduces confidence. Reversal signals: 3m reversal MEDIUM strength but no position. Given counter-trend SHORT setup with weak volume, confidence is moderate. Available short slots: 1.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15281 < EMA20=0.1535, RSI 46.2), 15m BEARISH (price=0.15277 < EMA20=0.1536, RSI 38.2), 3m BEARISH (price=0.15268 < EMA20=0.1531, RSI 36.0).

Counter-trade analysis shows STRONG alignment for SHORT (1h bullish vs 15m+3m bearish). Volume ratio 0.126 (WEAK) reduces confidence. Current SHORT position has MEDIUM reversal risk (htf and 3m reversal signals). Position slots: SHORT full (0 available), LONG available (2). Since counter-trend SHORT is valid but slots full, cannot open new SHORT, and cannot force LONG. Consider closing if reversal strengthens.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.15281 < EMA20=0.1535, RSI 46.2), 15m BEARISH (price=0.15271 < EMA20=0.1534, RSI 38.0), 3m BEARISH (price=0.15271 < EMA20=0.1528, RSI 42.8). All timeframes aligned bearish, but volume ratio 0.197 (WEAK) reduces confidence. Current SHORT position has NO_LOSS_RISK, minimal reversal signals. Position slots: SHORT full, cannot open new SHORT. Hold position.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.091 < EMA20=1.0959, RSI 44.8), 15m BEARISH (price=1.092 < EMA20=1.0953, RSI 43.2), 3m BULLISH (price=1.092 > EMA20=1.0919, RSI 49.0). Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM alignment for LONG (1h bearish vs 3m bullish). Volume ratio 0.127 (WEAK) reduces confidence. No position. Position slots: SHORT full, LONG available. Counter-trend LONG setup exists but confidence low due to weak volume and only 3m bullish; skip.\n\nADA: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4344 > EMA20=0.4329, RSI 54.7), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4338 < EMA20=0.4346, RSI 46.7), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4338 > EMA20=0.4336, RSI 49.9). Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM alignment for LONG (1h bullish vs 15m bearish). Volume ratio 0.326 (WEAK) but highest among coins. No position. Position slots: SHORT full, LONG available. Counter-trend LONG setup with better volume support; consider entry if confidence sufficient.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=13.36 < EMA20=13.3883, RSI 50.0), 15m BEARISH (price=13.35 < EMA20=13.4186, RSI 36.5), 3m BEARISH (price=13.35 < EMA20=13.3629, RSI 43.3). All timeframes aligned bearish, but volume ratio 0.203 (WEAK) reduces confidence. No position. Position slots: SHORT full, cannot open new SHORT. Skip.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=141.13 < EMA20=141.8488, RSI 46.6), 15m BEARISH (price=140.81 < EMA20=141.7152, RSI 35.7), 3m BEARISH (price=140.81 < EMA20=141.0228, RSI 39.4). All timeframes aligned bearish, but volume ratio 0.132 (WEAK) reduces confidence. No position. Position slots: SHORT full, cannot open new SHORT. Skip.\n\nGlobal regime neutral, short performance strong (100% win rate), no cooldowns. Volume weakness pervasive; only consider high-confidence setups. Available LONG slots: 2; SHORT slots: 0. Do not force LONG trades unless low/medium risk; counter-trend signals invalidate opposite trend-following.",

Counter-trade analysis shows STRONG alignment for SHORT (1h bullish vs 15m+3m bearish). Volume ratio 0.30x (WEAK) reduces confidence. Existing SHORT position has MEDIUM reversal risk (htf+3m reversal signals). Position currently at -0.60 PnL. Given short slots are FULL (0 available), cannot open new SHORT.

Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM alignment for LONG (1h bearish vs 3m bullish). Volume ratio 0.62x (NORMAL). No position. Long slots available (1), but confidence moderate due to mixed signals. Consider LONG with stop below 1h EMA20.\n\nADA: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4344 > EMA20=0.4329, RSI 54.7), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4346 < EMA20=0.4347, RSI 50.4), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4346 > EMA20=0.4337, RSI 55.3). Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM alignment for SHORT (1h bullish vs 15m bearish). Volume ratio 0.39x (WEAK) reduces confidence. Existing LONG position has NO reversal risk, PnL +0.20. Long slots available (1), but counter-trend SHORT signal invalidates trend-following LONG. HOLD.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=13.36 < EMA20=13.3883, RSI 50.0), 15m BEARISH (price=13.36 < EMA20=13.4147, RSI 39.2), 3m BEARISH (price=13.36 < EMA20=13.3643, RSI 46.1).

Volume too weak (ratio <= 0.20), skipping entry. HOLD.\n\nADA: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4337 > EMA20=0.4329, RSI=53.5), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4334 < EMA20=0.4346, RSI=45.3), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4334 < EMA20=0.4337, RSI=46.5). Mixed signals: 1h bullish but 15m/3m bearish (neutral regime). COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS shows strong alignment for counter-trend SHORT (htf BULLISH, 15m BEARISH, 3m BEARISH). Volume normal (ratio=0.70). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM against bullish trend. Valid counter-trend SHORT setup with confidence 0.65. However, short_slots_available=0 (SHORT_FULL), so cannot execute. Per constraint, do not open trend-following LONG. HOLD.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=13.35 < EMA20=13.3873, RSI=49.3), 15m BEARISH (price=13.34 < EMA20=13.4128, RSI=36.7), 3m BEARISH (price=13.34 < EMA20=13.3572, RSI=42.6). All timeframes aligned bearish with very weak volume (ratio=0.10). No position. Volume too weak (ratio <= 0.20), skipping entry. HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=140.81 < EMA20=141.8183, RSI=44.6), 15m BEARISH (price=140.92 < EMA20=141.6575, RSI=37.4), 3m BEARISH (price=140.92 < EMA20=140.9712, RSI=46.0). All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (ratio=0.31). No position. Volume weak but above 0.20 threshold. However, short_slots_available=0 (SHORT_FULL), so cannot open SHORT. HOLD.\n\nSummary: 2 existing SHORT positions (XRP, DOGE). Short slots full (0 available), long slots available=2. ADA has valid counter-trend SHORT but cannot execute due to slot limit, so no trades in opposite direction. Other coins either weak volume or no clear edge. Maintain positions and wait for slot availability or invalidation.",

Mixed regime - 1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish creates neutral conditions. Volume ratio 1.37x (NORMAL) provides decent conviction. COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS shows STRONG alignment for counter-trend SHORT (1h bullish but 15m+3m bearish). Risk level MEDIUM. This presents a valid counter-trend SHORT opportunity. However, SHORT slots are FULL (0 available). According to constraints: 'If a valid counter-trend signal exists but cannot be executed (e.g. limits), DO NOT open a trend-following trade in the opposite direction.' Therefore, cannot open LONG. Hold.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=13.33 < EMA20=13.381, RSI 48.0), 15m BEARISH (price=13.33 < EMA20=13.405, RSI 35.5), 3m BULLISH (price=13.36 > EMA20=13.353, RSI 49.9). Mixed signals with 1h+15m bearish but 3m bullish. Volume ratio 2.30x (STRONG) provides excellent conviction. COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS shows MEDIUM_RISK with 4 conditions met. This could support a counter-trend LONG (1h bearish but 15m+3m bullish). However, SHORT slots are FULL, and opening LONG would be trend-following against the counter-trend signal. Hold.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=140.9 < EMA20=141.734, RSI 45.2), 15m BEARISH (price=140.9 < EMA20=141.579, RSI 37.6), 3m BULLISH (price=141 > EMA20=140.938, RSI 49.6). Mixed signals similar to others. Volume ratio 0.14x (WEAK) is very low, significantly reducing confidence. COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS shows HIGH_RISK. No clear edge. Hold.\n\nPOSITION_SLOTS: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE (2 long slots available, 0 short slots available). Cannot open any new SHORT positions. Only LONG entries possible if high-confidence setups exist.\n\nMARKET_REGIME: Global regime NEUTRAL with weak strength (0.17). Supports cautious approach.\n\nPERFORMANCE: SHORT performance strong (100% win rate, +1.48 PnL), LONG performance poor (0% win rate, -1.30 PnL). No cooldowns active.\n\nOverall assessment: Mixed signals across most coins. Best potential counter-trend setup in ADA but cannot execute due to slot constraints. All existing positions should be held as invalidation conditions not met. No high-confidence LONG setups justify new entries given current market conditions.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is neutral (strength 0.17), with 1 bearish and 5 neutral coins, suggesting limited directional bias. Position slots: 3 open (1 LONG, 2 SHORT), 1 slot available (LONG only, SHORT full). Counter-trade analysis shows weak volume across most coins (ratio <0.5x), reducing confidence. Trend reversal data indicates STRONG reversal signals against ADA LONG position (15m+3m bearish vs 1h bullish), requiring close consideration. Directional performance favors SHORT (100% win rate, +1.48 PnL) over LONG (0% win rate, -1.30 PnL), but no cooldowns active. Analysis per coin: XRP: 1h BEARISH, 15m BEARISH, 3m BEARISH, all aligned bearish with weak volume (0.34x). Existing SHORT position has -0.11 PnL and 3m reversal signal (strength NONE), but 1h trend intact. Hold SHORT. DOGE: 1h BEARISH, 15m BEARISH, 3m BULLISH, mixed alignment (MEDIUM) with weak volume (0.31x). Existing SHORT position has +0.27 PnL and 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL), but 1h trend bearish. Hold SHORT. ASTER: 1h BEARISH, 15m BEARISH, 3m BEARISH, all aligned bearish with normal volume (0.96x). Strong trend-following SHORT setup, but SHORT slots full (0 available). Cannot open SHORT. No counter-trend LONG signal (3m bearish). Hold. ADA: 1h BULLISH, 15m BEARISH, 3m BEARISH, strong counter-trend alignment (15m+3m vs 1h) with very weak volume (0.04x). Existing LONG position has +0.41 PnL but STRONG reversal signals (15m+3m bearish), indicating high loss risk. Close LONG due to reversal. LINK: 1h BEARISH, 15m BEARISH, 3m BEARISH, all aligned bearish with weak volume (0.30x). Strong trend-following SHORT setup, but SHORT slots full. No counter-trend LONG signal. Hold. SOL: 1h BEARISH, 15m BEARISH, 3m BULLISH, mixed alignment (MEDIUM) with weak volume (0.26x). Potential counter-trend LONG (3m bullish vs 1h bearish), but volume weak and confidence low. With 1 LONG slot available, consider LOW confidence entry. Volume weakness (0.26x) and mixed signals reduce edge; skip to avoid low-quality trade. Summary: Close ADA LONG due to strong reversal; hold others; no new entries due to slot constraints or weak setups.",
