Market regime is bearish (strength 0.83), with 0 positions open and 5 slots available. Cooldowns: DOGE in coin cooldown (2 cycles), no directional cooldowns. Counter-trade analysis provided for XRP, ASTER, TRX. Apply rules: min confidence 0.4, same direction limit 2, sniper mode discipline. Startup behavior: cycles 1-3 observe unless exceptional setup; this is cycle 2, so cautious but can trade if high-confidence setup exists. Volume rule: if volume_ratio < 0.20, do not trade; check per coin. Counter-trend risk_level rules: HIGH_RISK requires confidence > 0.65, VERY_HIGH_RISK do not trade. Zone_weakening combined rule: check price_location and momentum. Profit erosion not applicable as no positions. Reversal warnings not applicable.

Counter-trade analysis: htf_trend BEARISH, 15m_trend BEARISH, 3m_trend BULLISH, alignment_strength MEDIUM, risk_level HIGH_RISK, volume_ratio 0.34 WEAK. Risk_level HIGH_RISK: requires confidence > 0.65; conditions total_met=2 (MEDIUM alignment + <3 conditions per rules). Volume_ratio 0.34 > 0.20, so trade allowed. Price_location LOWER_10 + RSI 35.2 indicates bounce risk; momentum WEAKENING on htf and 15m suggests trend exhaustion. Zone_weakening combined rule: LOWER_10_WEAKENING for SHORT entry: DO NOT open SHORT (trend exhausted at lows). For LONG entry: GOOD counter-trend opportunity if conditions align. Counter-trend setup: risk_level HIGH_RISK, need confidence > 0.65. Indicators: 3m bullish (price > EMA, RSI 59), but volume weak, ADX weak. Confidence estimated 0.5 (moderate).

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Market regime is strongly bearish (global_regime bearish, strength 0.83). Position slots: 1 short position (TRX), short_slots_available=1, long_slots_available=2, total available slots=4. No cooldowns active. Counter-trade analysis indicates VERY_HIGH_RISK for XRP and TRX, HIGH_RISK for ASTER, LINK, SOL. Trend reversal signals are INFORMATIONAL (3m only) for all coins, not strong enough for exits. Apply zone_weakening_combined_rule and momentum_conviction_rule. Evaluate each coin for best quantified edge.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=1.8817 < EMA20=1.8999, RSI 31.1, ADX 52.5 STRONG, structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 39.2, structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING, price_location MIDDLE). 3m BEARISH (RSI 47.4, supertrend DOWN). All timeframes aligned bearish with volume ratio 0.83 (NORMAL). Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength NONE, conditions total_met=1). Do NOT trade counter-trend per rule (risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK). Trend-following SHORT is valid, but 15m momentum WEAKENING suggests caution; however, price_location LOWER_10 + RSI 31.1 indicates potential bounce risk. Combined with zone_weakening_combined_rule: LOWER_10 + WEAKENING for SHORT entry? For SHORT entry: DO NOT open SHORT as trend exhausted at lows per rule. Prefer HOLD. No position, so hold.\n\nDOGE: Not in counter-trade analysis, but check market data? Data not provided; assume no clear signals. Trend reversal shows INFORMATIONAL 3m reversal, current_trend_htf BEARISH. Insufficient data; HOLD.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.696 < EMA20=0.7032, RSI 42.6, ADX 20.6 WEAK, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location MIDDLE). 15m BEARISH (RSI 42.7, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location MIDDLE). 3m BULLISH (RSI 61.1, supertrend DOWN). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Counter-trade analysis: HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength MEDIUM, conditions total_met=2). Risk_level HIGH_RISK requires extreme caution; confidence threshold >0.65 not met (no confidence provided). Volume ratio 0.40 (WEAK). 3m RSI 61.1 near overbought, but price_location MIDDLE. No strong edge; HOLD.\n\nTRX: Has SHORT position (unrealized PnL +0.36, confidence 0.54). 1h BEARISH (price=0.2839 < EMA20=0.2845, RSI 40.6, ADX 22.3 WEAK, structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING, price_location MIDDLE). 15m BEARISH (RSI 40.7, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 3m BEARISH (RSI 45.8, supertrend UP). Trend-following SHORT intact: 1h bearish, 15m bearish with momentum STRENGTHENING (good for holding), 3m bearish. Volume ratio 3.62 (STRONG) on 3m. Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK, but we have existing trend-following position. Check exit logic: reversal_signals strength INFORMATIONAL (3m only), not strong. Erosion_status NONE (<20% peak profit erosion). No zone_weakening issue (price_location LOWER_10 but momentum STRENGTHENING, not WEAKENING). Continue holding SHORT. Update stop-loss based on technicals: support at 0.2837 (strength 3), set stop-loss above with buffer.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.34 < EMA20=12.4938, RSI 36.9, ADX 32.9 MODERATE, structure LH_LL, momentum STABLE, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 40.2, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location MIDDLE). 3m BULLISH (RSI 54.3, supertrend DOWN). Mixed signals. Counter-trade analysis: HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength MEDIUM, conditions total_met=2). Risk_level HIGH_RISK requires extreme caution; confidence not provided. Volume ratio 0.75 (NORMAL). 1h price_location LOWER_10 + RSI 36.9 indicates potential bounce, but 15m momentum WEAKENING. Zone_weakening_combined_rule: LOWER_10 + WEAKENING for SHORT entry? For SHORT entry: DO NOT open SHORT as trend exhausted at lows. For LONG entry: GOOD counter-trend opportunity if conditions align, but risk_level HIGH_RISK and confidence likely low. Prefer HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=124.2 < EMA20=125.4707, RSI 37.5, ADX 28.9 MODERATE, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STABLE, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 41.2, structure LH_LL, momentum STABLE, price_location MIDDLE). 3m BULLISH (RSI 55.1, supertrend DOWN). Mixed signals. Counter-trade analysis: HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength MEDIUM, conditions total_met=2). Risk_level HIGH_RISK requires extreme caution. Volume ratio 1.03 (NORMAL). 1h price_location LOWER_10 + RSI 37.5 indicates potential bounce, but 15m momentum STABLE. No clear edge; HOLD.\n\nOverall: Only TRX has a position; hold it. No new entries due to mixed signals, high risk in counter-trades, or zone_weakening rules. Maintain discipline.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish (strength 0.83), with 5 bearish coins and 1 neutral. Position slots: 1 open (TRX short), 4 available (2 long, 1 short slots). Cooldowns: none. Counter-trade analysis and reversal signals inform decisions. Apply rules: min confidence 0.4, same direction limit 2, zone_weakening combined rule, risk_level for counter-trend, volume ratio >0.20 required, and startup behavior (cycle 9, normal mode).\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=1.8817 < EMA20=1.8999, RSI 31.1, ADX 52.5 STRONG, structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10), 15m BEARISH (RSI 39.2, momentum WEAKENING), 3m BEARISH (RSI 44.6). All timeframes aligned bearish. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment NONE), volume_ratio 0.91 NORMAL. Reversal: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL (no position). No counter-trend opportunity per risk_level. Trend-following SHORT possible, but 15m momentum WEAKENING and price_location LOWER_10 + RSI<25 indicates bounce risk (LOWER_10 rule). Combined with zone_weakening: LOWER_10 + WEAKENING for SHORT entry: DO NOT open SHORT. Prefer HOLD. Confidence low for new trade.\n\nDOGE: Not in counter-trade analysis; check market data: missing from MARKET_DATA, likely neutral. Reversal: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL, current_trend_htf BEARISH. Insufficient data; HOLD.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.696 < EMA20=0.7032, RSI 42.6, ADX 20.6 WEAK, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING), 15m BEARISH (RSI 42.7, momentum WEAKENING), 3m BULLISH (RSI 57.2, price=0.696 > EMA20=0.6949). Counter-trade analysis: risk_level HIGH_RISK (alignment MEDIUM, conditions 2), volume_ratio 1.16 STRONG. Reversal: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL. Counter-trend LONG opportunity, but risk_level HIGH_RISK requires extreme caution per rules. 15m momentum WEAKENING and price_location MIDDLE, no zone_weakening. Volume strong, but confidence limited due to high risk. Prefer HOLD.\n\nTRX: 1h BEARISH (price=0.2839 < EMA20=0.2845, RSI 40.6, ADX 22.3 WEAK, structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING), 15m BEARISH (RSI 40.7, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10), 3m BULLISH (RSI 57.5, price=0.2841 > EMA20=0.2839, bb_signal OVERBOUGHT). Existing SHORT position: unrealized_pnl -0.18, erosion_status NONE. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level MEDIUM_RISK (alignment MEDIUM, conditions 3), volume_ratio 4.56 STRONG. Reversal: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL. Counter-trend LONG opportunity with MEDIUM_RISK, but short_slots_available=1, and constraint: if valid counter-trend (LONG) but slots full, do not open trend-following SHORT. Here, slots not full, but existing SHORT position. Evaluate exit: reversal_strength INFORMATIONAL (only 3m reversal), erosion_status NONE, profit_erosion rules: no action. However, 15m momentum STRENGTHENING bearish and price_location LOWER_10 + RSI<25? RSI 40.7 not <25, but LOWER_10 indicates potential bounce. Zone_weakening: LOWER_10 + STRENGTHENING for SHORT exit? SHORT is SAFE at LOWER_10 per rule. Continue holding. No new entry due to existing position and mixed signals.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.34 < EMA20=12.49, RSI 36.9, ADX 32.9 MODERATE, structure LH_LL, momentum STABLE, price_location LOWER_10), 15m BEARISH (RSI 40.2, momentum WEAKENING), 3m BULLISH (RSI 51.7, price=12.35 > EMA20=12.34). Counter-trade analysis: risk_level HIGH_RISK (alignment MEDIUM, conditions 2), volume_ratio 0.59 WEAK. Reversal: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL. Counter-trend LONG opportunity, but risk_level HIGH_RISK and volume_ratio <0.20? No, 0.59 >0.20, but volume_strength WEAK. High risk requires extreme caution; prefer HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=124.2 < EMA20=125.47, RSI 37.5, ADX 28.9 MODERATE, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STABLE, price_location LOWER_10), 15m BEARISH (RSI 41.2, momentum STABLE), 3m BULLISH (RSI 54.9, price=124.51 > EMA20=124.34).

Confidence for LONG: moderate due to risk_level MEDIUM_RISK and alignment. However, short_slots_available=1, and no slot conflict. Evaluate edge: 1h bearish, but counter-trend setup with conditions. Could enter LONG with caution, but check same_direction_limit: long_slots_available=2, so allowed. Confidence >0.4 required; estimate 0.6 based on volume and conditions.

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=1.8817 < EMA20=1.8999, RSI 31.1, ADX 52.5 STRONG), 15m BEARISH (RSI 39.2, structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING), 3m BEARISH (RSI 45.9). All timeframes aligned bearish. COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS shows VERY_HIGH_RISK for counter-trend LONG (alignment_strength NONE, volume_ratio 0.64 WEAK). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL but no position. Price_location LOWER_10 on 1h + RSI 31.1 indicates potential bounce risk, but trend strongly bearish. No clear edge for SHORT entry as momentum WEAKENING. HOLD.\n\nDOGE: No COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS data. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL, current_trend_htf BEARISH. No market data provided, so cannot analyze. HOLD.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.696 < EMA20=0.7032, RSI 42.6, ADX 20.6 WEAK), 15m BEARISH (RSI 42.7, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING), 3m BULLISH (RSI 56.1). Mixed signals. COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS shows HIGH_RISK for counter-trend LONG (alignment_strength MEDIUM, volume_ratio 0.92 NORMAL). Risk_level HIGH_RISK per counter_trend rules requires confidence > 0.65, but no strong setup. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL. Price_location MIDDLE on both timeframes. No clear edge. HOLD.\n\nTRX: 1h BEARISH (price=0.2839 < EMA20=0.2845, RSI 40.6, ADX 22.3 WEAK), 15m BEARISH (RSI 40.7, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING), 3m BULLISH (RSI 57.5). Mixed signals. Existing SHORT position with unrealized_pnl -0.18, erosion_status NONE. COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS shows HIGH_RISK for counter-trend LONG (alignment_strength MEDIUM, volume_ratio 0.09 WEAK). Risk_level HIGH_RISK requires confidence > 0.65, but volume_strength WEAK and no strong setup. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL against SHORT position. Reversal_strength INFORMATIONAL alone not enough to exit per rules. Price_location LOWER_10 on 15m + RSI 40.7 indicates potential bounce risk, but momentum STRENGTHENING bearish. Continue holding SHORT as trend still bearish and no strong reversal signals.\n\nLINK: No COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS data. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL, current_trend_htf BEARISH. No market data provided, so cannot analyze. HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=124.2 < EMA20=125.47, RSI 37.5, ADX 28.9 MODERATE), 15m BEARISH (RSI 41.2, structure LH_LL, momentum STABLE), 3m BULLISH (RSI 53.4). Mixed signals. Existing LONG position with unrealized_pnl -0.16, erosion_status NONE. COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS shows MEDIUM_RISK for counter-trend LONG (alignment_strength MEDIUM, volume_ratio 3.15 STRONG). Risk_level MEDIUM_RISK allows execution if confidence > 0.65, but this is a counter-trend LONG against 1h BEARISH trend. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows htf_reversal TRUE (against LONG position) and 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL. Reversal_strength combined (htf+3m) suggests STRONG reversal against LONG. Price_location LOWER_10 on 1h + RSI 37.5 indicates potential bounce support, but htf_reversal is concerning. Per reversal_warning rules, STRONG reversal (htf+3m) against position suggests consider closing if PnL negative. Current PnL is negative (-0.16). Close LONG position.\n\nPOSITION_SLOTS: long_slots_available=1, short_slots_available=1. No slot constraints for new trades.\nCOOLDOWN_STATUS: No cooldowns active.\nMARKET_REGIME: Global regime bearish (strength 0.83).\nStartup behavior: Cycle 10, normal trading mode.\nVolume check: All coins have volume_ratio > 0.20 except TRX (0.09) but it has existing position.\nDecision: Close SOL LONG due to STRONG reversal signals against position with negative PnL. Hold other positions. No new entries as no clear high-confidence setups.",

Market regime is bearish (strength 0.83), with 5 bearish coins, 1 neutral. Position slots: 1 open (TRX short), 4 available (2 long, 1 short slots). Cooldowns: SOL coin cooldown (1 cycle), no directional cooldowns. Counter-trade analysis provided for XRP, DOGE, ASTER, TRX. Trend reversal data shows only 3m reversal signals (strength INFORMATIONAL) for all coins, no strong reversals. Volume ratios mostly weak, except TRX strong. Apply rules: min confidence 0.4, same direction limit 2, sniper mode discipline. Startup cycles >3, normal trading mode.\n\nXRP: 1h bearish (price=1.8817 < EMA20=1.8999, RSI 31.1, ADX 52.5 STRONG), 15m bearish (RSI 37.5, structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING), 3m bearish (RSI 45.4). All timeframes aligned bearish. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength NONE, volume_ratio 0.31 weak). Rule: Do NOT trade if risk_level is VERY_HIGH_RISK. Volume ratio 0.31 > 0.20, but weak volume_strength. Price_location LOWER_10 on 1h, RSI 31.1 not <25, so bounce risk low. No strong reversal signals.

Mixed signals: 1h+15m bearish, 3m bullish. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength MEDIUM, volume_ratio 0.65 weak). Rule: HIGH_RISK requires extreme caution; prefer HOLD. Volume ratio 0.65 > 0.20, but weak. Price_location LOWER_10 on 1h and 15m, RSI 38.4 not <25, bounce risk moderate. Momentum WEAKENING on 15m, trend conviction weak. No strong reversal signals.

Counter-trade analysis: risk_level HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength MEDIUM, volume_ratio 1.0 normal). Rule: HIGH_RISK requires extreme caution; prefer HOLD. Volume ratio 1.0 > 0.20, normal. Price_location MIDDLE on 1h and 15m, no extreme risk. Momentum WEAKENING on 15m, trend conviction weak. No strong reversal signals.

Mixed signals: 1h bearish, 15m+3m bullish. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level MEDIUM_RISK (alignment_strength STRONG, volume_ratio 0.48 weak). Rule: MEDIUM_RISK execute if confidence > 0.65. Current confidence from position is 0.5436 < 0.65, so not high enough for new entry. Existing short position: unrealized PnL -0.536, erosion_status NONE, reversal_signals 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL (weak). Profit erosion rules: NONE + INFORMATIONAL reversal = continue holding. Invalidation condition: If 1h price closes above 1h EMA20 * 1.002 (approx 0.28448*1.002=0.2850). Current price 0.2843 below, thesis not invalidated. Volume ratio 3.21 strong, but volume_strength STRONG supports bullish momentum. Price_location MIDDLE on 1h, no extreme risk. bb_signal OVERBOUGHT on 3m, caution for shorts.

Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL -$0.71. Reversal signals: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL (strength). Price_location MIDDLE on 15m (70th percentile) suggests overextended bounce. Zone_weakening rule: 15m momentum WEAKENING at UPPER zone - trend exhaustion. For existing SHORT: continue holding as trend favorably exhausting.

Insufficient data for decision; assume HOLD.\n\nASTER: MARKET_DATA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.696 < EMA20=0.703, RSI 42.6, ADX 20.6 WEAK, momentum WEAKENING, structure UNCLEAR). 15m BEARISH (RSI 33.3, momentum STABLE, price_location LOWER_10, ADX 48.6 STRONG, supertrend DOWN). 3m BEARISH (RSI 33.2, ADX 41.2 STRONG, supertrend DOWN, volume_ratio 3.99 STRONG). All timeframes aligned bearish with strong ADX on 15m/3m. Volume strong on 3m. COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength NONE, volume_strength WEAK). Per rules: VERY_HIGH_RISK counter-trade risk means DO NOT trade. Trend-following SHORT is valid, but price_location LOWER_10 + RSI 33.2 indicates potential bounce risk. Given strong bearish alignment and volume, SHORT could be considered, but caution due to LOWER_10. Confidence low due to bounce risk. HOLD.\n\nTRX: MARKET_DATA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.2839 < EMA20=0.2845, RSI 40.6, ADX 22.3 WEAK, momentum WEAKENING, structure LH_LL). 15m BULLISH (RSI 56.6, momentum WEAKENING, price_location MIDDLE, ADX 24.4 WEAK, supertrend DOWN). 3m BULLISH (RSI 65.2, ADX 31.8 MODERATE, supertrend UP). Mixed signals: 1h bearish, 15m/3m bullish. COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS: risk_level MEDIUM_RISK (alignment_strength STRONG, volume_strength WEAK). Per rules: MEDIUM_RISK counter-trend (since 15m/3m bullish vs 1h bearish) is executable if confidence >0.65. Current position: SHORT (unrealized PnL -0.71, erosion_status NONE). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA: 3m_reversal true (strength INFORMATIONAL), loss_risk_signal MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Reversal_strength INFORMATIONAL is noise; continue watching. Profit erosion rules: NONE + INFORMATIONAL = no close. However, 15m momentum WEAKENING and price near support (0.2837) suggests bearish trend may be exhausting. Zone_weakening rule: LOWER_10 not applicable (price_location MIDDLE). But counter-trend opportunity exists for LONG (MEDIUM_RISK). Check slots: short_slots_available=1, long_slots_available=2. Could consider LONG, but confidence from data: RSI 65.2 on 3m is overbought, volume_strength WEAK. Confidence likely <0.65. HOLD position; monitor for exit if reversal strengthens.\n\nLINK: MARKET_DATA: 1h BEARISH (price=12.34 < EMA20=12.49, RSI 36.9, ADX 32.9 MODERATE, momentum STABLE, structure LH_LL, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 30.6, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10, ADX 61.5 STRONG, supertrend UP). 3m BEARISH (RSI 36.3, ADX 21.2 WEAK, supertrend DOWN, volume_ratio 1.69 STRONG). All timeframes aligned bearish with strong ADX on 15m. Price_location LOWER_10 on both 1h and 15m + RSI 30.6/36.3 indicates potential bounce risk. COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength NONE, volume_strength NORMAL). Per rules: VERY_HIGH_RISK counter-trade risk means DO NOT trade. Trend-following SHORT is valid, but LOWER_10 bounce risk reduces confidence. Volume strong on 3m supports bearish momentum. However, given bounce risk and VERY_HIGH_RISK counter-trade, prefer HOLD.\n\nSOL: Not in MARKET_DATA, but from TREND_REVERSAL_DATA: 1h BEARISH, 3m BEARISH, no reversal signals. No position. Insufficient data for decision; assume HOLD.\n\nOverall: No high-confidence setups. ASTER and LINK have strong bearish trends but bounce risks. TRX position held with minor loss.

All timeframes aligned bearish with volume ratio 0.44x (WEAK). Counter-trade analysis: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK - do NOT trade counter-trend. Trend-following SHORT valid, but volume_strength WEAK reduces conviction. 15m momentum WEAKENING + price_location LOWER_10 triggers zone_weakening rule: LOWER_10_WEAKENING for SHORT entry - DO NOT open SHORT. Prefer HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=124.09 < EMA20=125.46, RSI 36.8, ADX 28.8 MODERATE), 15m BEARISH (RSI 36.5, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STABLE, price_location LOWER_10), 3m BEARISH (RSI 37.6). All timeframes aligned bearish with volume ratio 1.59x. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK - do NOT trade counter-trend. Trend-following SHORT valid, but 15m price_location LOWER_10 + RSI 36.5 suggests bounce risk; momentum STABLE, so zone_weakening not triggered. Volume_strength NORMAL, ADX MODERATE. SHORT edge exists with moderate confidence.\n\nOverall: Market regime bearish (strength 0.83), no cooldowns, position slots: long_slots_available=2, short_slots_available=1. Only XRP and SOL offer valid SHORT setups with acceptable risk; DOGE, ASTER, LINK have zone_weakening or volume issues; TRX volume too low. Maintain discipline: only trade high-probability setups.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Market regime is bearish (strength 0.83), with 5 bearish coins and 1 neutral. Position slots: 2 shorts open (short_slots_available=0), 0 longs (long_slots_available=2), total available slots=3. Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE, so do NOT propose new SHORT entries; only LONG entries if low/medium risk and high confidence. Counter-trade analysis shows most coins VERY_HIGH_RISK for counter-trend (alignment NONE), except TRX with MEDIUM_RISK (alignment STRONG, 15m/3m bullish vs htf bearish). Trend reversal detection: XRP has 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL against short position, but loss_risk LOW_LOSS_RISK; TRX no reversal. Volume rules: LINK volume_ratio 0.893 (>0.20), so trade allowed. Startup cycles >3, normal trading mode. Apply zone_weakening rule: check price_location and momentum. Analyze each coin:\n\nXRP: htf BEARISH (price=1.877 < EMA20=1.899, RSI 28.6 oversold, ADX 52 STRONG), 15m BEARISH (RSI 33.8, structure LH_LL, momentum STABLE, price_location LOWER_10), 3m BEARISH (RSI 39.5). All timeframes aligned bearish, but price_location LOWER_10 + RSI oversold suggests bounce risk. Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (no alignment), so do not consider LONG. Short position exists with unrealized PnL -0.17, erosion_status NONE. Reversal_strength INFORMATIONAL (3m only), not strong enough to close. Hold short.\n\nDOGE: htf BEARISH (price=0.13007 < EMA20=0.13185, RSI 36.5, ADX 27 MODERATE), 15m BEARISH (RSI 33.9, structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10), 3m BEARISH (RSI 37.1). All bearish, but momentum WEAKENING + price_location LOWER_10 indicates trend exhaustion. Zone_weakening rule: LOWER_10_WEAKENING for SHORT entry: DO NOT open SHORT. For LONG entry: GOOD counter-trend opportunity, but counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK (no alignment), so do not LONG. No position. Hold.\n\nASTER: htf BEARISH (price=0.687 < EMA20=0.702, RSI 37.2, ADX 22 WEAK), 15m BEARISH (RSI 33.3, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STABLE, price_location LOWER_10), 3m BEARISH (RSI 36.5). All bearish, but ADX weak and price_location LOWER_10. Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (no alignment). No position. Hold.\n\nTRX: htf BEARISH (price=0.2844 < EMA20=0.28453, RSI 46.8, ADX 20 WEAK), but market_regime NEUTRAL. 15m BULLISH (RSI 56.6, momentum WEAKENING, price_location MIDDLE), 3m BULLISH (RSI 66.4 overbought). Alignment conflict: htf vs 15m/3m. Counter-trade analysis: MEDIUM_RISK (alignment STRONG, conditions met 2), volume_ratio 1.07 NORMAL. This is a valid counter-trend LONG opportunity (against htf bearish). However, short position exists with unrealized PnL -0.89, erosion_status NONE. Reversal_strength NONE. According to constraints, short_slots_available=0, so cannot open new SHORT. For LONG, slots available, but must evaluate risk: MEDIUM_RISK with confidence >0.65? Confidence from data unclear; need min_confidence 0.4. RSI 3m 66.4 overbought suggests caution. Price near support@0.2839. Could consider LONG as counter-trend, but with high confidence? Not enough data for high confidence. Prefer hold due to existing short and overbought RSI.\n\nLINK: htf BEARISH (price=12.3 < EMA20=12.49, RSI 34.9, ADX 33 MODERATE), 15m BEARISH (RSI 30.6, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10), 3m BEARISH (RSI 39.6). All bearish, but momentum WEAKENING + price_location LOWER_10 indicates exhaustion. Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (no alignment). Volume_ratio 0.893 (>0.20), trade allowed. No position. Hold.\n\nSOL: htf BEARISH (price=124.09 < EMA20=125.46, RSI 36.8, ADX 29 MODERATE), 15m BEARISH (RSI 36.5, momentum STABLE, price_location LOWER_10), 3m BEARISH (RSI 39.1). All bearish, price_location LOWER_10 suggests bounce risk. Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (no alignment). No position.

Counter-trade analysis: risk_level HIGH_RISK (MEDIUM alignment, 2 conditions met). Zone_weakening rule: LOWER_10 + WEAKENING on 15m? Actually 15m momentum WEAKENING but price_location MIDDLE, not LOWER_10. For SHORT entry: LOWER_10 + WEAKENING would signal DO NOT SHORT, but here 15m price_location is MIDDLE, so rule doesn't apply. However, 1h LOWER_10 + RSI<25 indicates bounce risk. Volume ratio 0.98 normal. SuperTrend UP on 15m but DOWN on 3m. Mixed signals with 3m bullish but against HTF trend. Risk_level HIGH_RISK per counter-trade rules: requires extreme caution.

All bearish. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK (NONE alignment, 2 conditions). Volume ratio 0.65 weak (<0.7). Zone_weakening: 15m momentum WEAKENING but price_location MIDDLE, not LOWER_10. However, 1h LOWER_10 + RSI<25? RSI 39.2 >25, so no extreme oversold. SuperTrend DOWN on all. Weak volume suggests lack of conviction. HOLD.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.3 < EMA20=12.4719, RSI 34.9, ADX 35.7 MODERATE, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 35.0, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location MIDDLE). 3m BEARISH (RSI 44.3).

Position slots: short_slots_available=0 (full), long_slots_available=2, total_open=2, max_positions=5. Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE, so only propose LONG entries if LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence. Counter-trade analysis shows HIGH_RISK or VERY_HIGH_RISK for all coins, restricting counter-trend LONG entries. Trend reversal data shows only INFORMATIONAL 3m reversals for some coins, not strong enough to close positions. Volume ratios: XRP 0.89 (NORMAL), DOGE 0.98 (NORMAL), ASTER 0.39 (WEAK), LINK 0.62 (WEAK), SOL 0.24 (WEAK). Hard rule: volume_ratio < 0.20 means DO NOT TRADE, but all are above 0.20. Startup behavior: cycle 25, normal trading mode. Cooldown status: no directional or coin cooldowns. Analyze each coin:\n\nXRP: htf BEARISH (price=1.8786 < EMA20=1.8975, RSI 29.8 oversold, ADX 54.9 STRONG, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 44.7, momentum WEAKENING, structure RANGE, price_location MIDDLE). 3m BULLISH (price=1.8822 > EMA20=1.8813, RSI 53.0). Counter-trade analysis: HIGH_RISK (htf BEARISH, 15m BEARISH, 3m BULLISH, alignment_strength MEDIUM, conditions total_met=2). Risk_level HIGH_RISK per counter_trend rules: MEDIUM alignment + <3 conditions, evaluate carefully, prefer HOLD. Volume ratio 0.89 NORMAL. Position: short with unrealized PnL -0.85, erosion_status NONE. Reversal signals: 3m reversal true, strength INFORMATIONAL only, not strong enough to close. Short slots full, cannot open new SHORT. LONG entry: counter-trend opportunity but HIGH_RISK and short slots full, constraint says do not force LONG unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. Therefore, HOLD.\n\nDOGE: htf BEARISH (price=0.13014 < EMA20=0.1317, RSI 37.1, ADX 28.5 MODERATE, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 38.2, momentum WEAKENING, structure LH_LL, price_location LOWER_10). 3m BEARISH (price=0.13011 < EMA20=0.1303, RSI 42.0). Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength NONE, conditions total_met=1). Risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK per rules: no alignment, do NOT trade. Volume ratio 0.98 NORMAL. No position. Short slots full, cannot open SHORT. LONG entry: counter-trend but VERY_HIGH_RISK, do not trade. HOLD.\n\nASTER: htf BEARISH (price=0.69 < EMA20=0.7014, RSI 39.2, ADX 24.1 WEAK, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 37.8, momentum WEAKENING, structure UNCLEAR, price_location MIDDLE). 3m BEARISH (price=0.691 < EMA20=0.6920, RSI 45.2). Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength NONE, conditions total_met=2). Risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK, do not trade. Volume ratio 0.39 WEAK. No position. Short slots full, cannot open SHORT. LONG entry: counter-trend but VERY_HIGH_RISK, do not trade. HOLD.\n\nLINK: htf BEARISH (price=12.3 < EMA20=12.4719, RSI 34.9, ADX 35.7 MODERATE, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 35.0, momentum WEAKENING, structure UNCLEAR, price_location MIDDLE). 3m BEARISH (price=12.29 < EMA20=12.3167, RSI 40.0). Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength NONE, conditions total_met=1). Risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK, do not trade. Volume ratio 0.62 WEAK. No position. Short slots full, cannot open SHORT. LONG entry: counter-trend but VERY_HIGH_RISK, do not trade. HOLD.\n\nSOL: htf BEARISH (price=124.23 < EMA20=125.3516, RSI 37.8, ADX 31.1 MODERATE, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 37.9, momentum WEAKENING, structure UNCLEAR, price_location MIDDLE). 3m BEARISH (price=124.11 < EMA20=124.2643, RSI 41.9). Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength NONE, conditions total_met=1). Risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK, do not trade. Volume ratio 0.24 WEAK.

LONG entry: counter-trend but VERY_HIGH_RISK, do not trade. HOLD.\n\nTRX: Not in market data, but from trend reversal data: htf NEUTRAL, 3m NEUTRAL, no reversal signals. No position. Since not in market data, assume no clear edge. HOLD.\n\nOverall: Short slots full, all counter-trade opportunities are HIGH_RISK or VERY_HIGH_RISK, so no valid LONG entries. Existing positions (XRP and SOL shorts) show only INFORMATIONAL reversals, erosion_status NONE, so hold. No new trades proposed.",

Position: short with unrealized PnL -1.33, erosion_status NONE. Reversal signals: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL against short (strength INFORMATIONAL). Combined with erosion_status NONE, no exit signal. Invalidation condition: If 1h price closes above 1h EMA20 * 1.002. Current price 1.8834, stop_loss 1.8857, close but not triggered. Decision: HOLD short, no new entry due to HIGH_RISK counter-trade and short slots full.\n\nSOL: htf BEARISH (price=124.23 < EMA20=125.35, RSI 37.8, ADX 31.1 MODERATE, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10), 15m BEARISH (RSI 38.4, momentum WEAKENING, structure UNCLEAR), 3m BEARISH (RSI 47.9, price=124.24 < EMA20=124.26). Alignment: all bearish. Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (htf BEARISH, 15m BEARISH, 3m BEARISH, alignment_strength NONE, conditions total_met=1). Risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK per counter-trend rules: No alignment, do NOT trade. Volume ratio 0.49 WEAK (<0.5, caution). Position: short with unrealized PnL -0.52, erosion_status NONE. Reversal signals: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL against short. No exit signal. Invalidation condition: If 1h price closes above 1h EMA20 * 1.002. Decision: HOLD short, no new entry due to VERY_HIGH_RISK and short slots full.\n\nDOGE: Market data not provided in MARKET_DATA, but from TREND_REVERSAL_DATA: htf BEARISH, 3m NEUTRAL, reversal INFORMATIONAL. No position. Volume not given, assume normal. Counter-trade analysis not provided, but based on htf BEARISH, likely similar risk. Short slots full, so cannot open SHORT. LONG entry would be counter-trend, but no data to assess risk_level. Without clear edge, HOLD.\n\nASTER: Market data not provided. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA: htf BEARISH, 3m NEUTRAL, reversal INFORMATIONAL. No position. Similar to DOGE, HOLD.\n\nTRX: Market data not provided. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA: htf NEUTRAL, 3m NEUTRAL, reversal NONE. No position. Neutral regime, but no data for analysis. HOLD.\n\nLINK: Market data not provided. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA: htf BEARISH, 3m NEUTRAL, reversal INFORMATIONAL. No position. Volume not given; hard rule: if volume ratio <0.20, do NOT trade. Assume volume normal, but no data. HOLD.\n\nOverall: Short slots full, so no new SHORT entries. LONG entries only if LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence. Counter-trade analysis shows HIGH_RISK or VERY_HIGH_RISK for XRP and SOL, so avoid LONG. Other coins lack data or clear edge. Maintain existing positions, monitor for exits.",

Counter-trade analysis: htf_trend BEARISH, 15m_trend BULLISH, 3m_trend BULLISH, alignment_strength STRONG, risk_level MEDIUM_RISK, volume_ratio 1.5 (NORMAL). This is a counter-trend LONG opportunity (trading against 1h bearish trend). According to counter_trend rules, MEDIUM_RISK with confidence > 0.65 is executable. However, check zone_weakening rule: 15m momentum WEAKENING, price_location MIDDLE (not extreme), so no zone_weakening conflict. Reversal signals: has_position SHORT, 3m_reversal true (strength INFORMATIONAL) against position, loss_risk_signal MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Combined with profit_erosion_rules: erosion_status NONE, but reversal_strength INFORMATIONAL alone not enough to close. Position slots: short_slots_available=0 (SHORT_FULL), so cannot open new SHORT. Counter-trade LONG is valid but requires long_slots_available=2. However, constraint_instruction: If a direction is FULL, do NOT force trades in the other direction unless they are LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK (High Confidence alone is NOT enough). This is MEDIUM_RISK, so LONG entry is allowed. But also check: if identify valid counter-trend opportunity (LONG) but cannot execute because slots full? Long slots are available (2), so can execute. Decision: Close SHORT position due to counter-trend signals and MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK, then consider LONG entry if confidence high. Confidence from counter-trade analysis: volume_ratio 1.5, RSI_3m 59.1, alignment STRONG. Estimate confidence 0.68 (>0.65).

Counter-trade analysis: htf_trend BEARISH, 15m_trend BEARISH, 3m_trend BEARISH, alignment_strength NONE, risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK. According to counter_trend rules, do NOT trade if risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK. Also, zone_weakening rule: 15m momentum WEAKENING and price_location LOWER_10. For SHORT entry: DO NOT open SHORT (trend exhausted at lows). For LONG entry: GOOD counter-trend opportunity if conditions align, but risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK prohibits. Volume_ratio 1.45 (NORMAL).

Counter-trade analysis: htf_trend BEARISH, 15m_trend BEARISH, 3m_trend BEARISH, alignment_strength NONE, risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK. Do NOT trade per counter_trend rules. Volume_ratio 1.247 (STRONG). Trend reversal data: no position, reversal_signals strength INFORMATIONAL (3m_reversal true). Zone_weakening_combined_rule: LOWER_10 on both 1h and 15m, but 15m momentum WEAKENING. For SHORT entry: DO NOT open SHORT if LOWER_10 + WEAKENING (trend exhausted at lows). Prefer HOLD or evaluate LONG. However, risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK prohibits counter-trend LONG. HOLD.\n\nDOGE: Data not in MARKET_DATA, but in TREND_REVERSAL_DATA: has_position false, reversal_signals strength INFORMATIONAL (3m_reversal true), current_trend_htf BEARISH, current_trend_3m NEUTRAL. No detailed indicators; assume no clear setup. HOLD.\n\nASTER: Data not in MARKET_DATA, but in TREND_REVERSAL_DATA: similar to DOGE. HOLD.\n\nSOL: Data not in MARKET_DATA, but in TREND_REVERSAL_DATA: has_position false, reversal_signals strength INFORMATIONAL (3m_reversal true), current_trend_htf BEARISH, current_trend_3m NEUTRAL. No detailed indicators; assume no clear setup. HOLD.\n\nOverall: Only XRP has position; close due to weak volume and reversal signals. Others HOLD. No new entries due to volume rule or risk_level.",

Counter-trend cooldown is 0, but relaxed_countertrend_cycles is 1, indicating caution for counter-trend trades. Historical context shows recent LONG bias but poor performance. I must avoid LONG entries due to directional cooldown and XRP due to coin cooldown.

All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 0.407 (WEAK), volume_strength WEAK. Counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK for counter-trend LONG, so avoid LONG. For SHORT, trend-following setup is strong, but note 15m momentum WEAKENING and price_location LOWER_10: zone_weakening_combined_rule indicates LOWER_10_WEAKENING means DO NOT open SHORT as trend exhausted at lows. Also, 15m momentum WEAKENING suggests wait for stabilization. HOLD.\n\nASTER: 1h bearish (price=0.695 < EMA20=0.701857, RSI 43.52, ADX 24.14 WEAK, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING), 15m bearish (RSI 41.67, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location MIDDLE), 3m bullish (RSI 52.37, supertrend DOWN). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Counter-trade analysis shows HIGH_RISK for counter-trend LONG with alignment_strength MEDIUM. Since LONG is in cooldown, avoid LONG.

All timeframes aligned bearish except 3m supertrend UP conflicting. Volume ratio 0.696 (WEAK), volume_strength WEAK. Counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK for counter-trend LONG, so avoid LONG. For SHORT, trend-following setup is strong with 1h momentum STRENGTHENING, but 15m momentum WEAKENING and price_location MIDDLE. No zone_weakening issue. However, 3m supertrend UP and OBV divergence BULLISH suggest potential reversal risk. Confidence low. HOLD.\n\nXRP, LINK, TRX: Not provided in market data, but XRP is in coin cooldown, so HOLD for XRP. LINK and TRX no data, assume HOLD.\n\nOverall, no high-confidence setups.

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Market regime is BEARISH globally (bearish_count=6). No positions open, all slots available (5). Startup behavior: cycle 35, normal trading mode. Counter-trade analysis provided for each coin. Volume ratios mostly weak (<0.75x).\n\nXRP: htf BEARISH (price=1.8861 < EMA20=1.8971, RSI 37.4, ADX 51 STRONG, structure LH_LL). 15m: price=1.8861, RSI 50.1, momentum WEAKENING, structure UNCLEAR, price_location MIDDLE. 3m: price=1.8905 > EMA20=1.8850, RSI 68.1 (overbought), bb_signal OVERBOUGHT, supertrend DOWN. Counter-trade: htf_trend BEARISH, 15m_trend BULLISH, 3m_trend BULLISH, alignment_strength STRONG, risk_level MEDIUM_RISK. This is a counter-trend LONG setup (trading against htf bearish). Risk_level MEDIUM_RISK allows execution if confidence > 0.65. However, 3m RSI 68.1 overbought + bb_signal OVERBOUGHT suggests near-term pullback risk. Volume ratio 0.69 weak. 15m momentum WEAKENING indicates trend exhaustion. No zone_weakening rule triggered (price_location MIDDLE). Confidence moderate due to overbought 3m. HOLD.\n\nDOGE: htf BEARISH (price=0.13031 < EMA20=0.13157, RSI 38.6, ADX 30 MODERATE, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m: price=0.13031, RSI 39.7, momentum WEAKENING, structure LH_LL, price_location LOWER_10. 3m: price=0.13049 > EMA20=0.13031, RSI 57.4, supertrend DOWN. Counter-trade: htf_trend BEARISH, 15m_trend BEARISH, 3m_trend BULLISH, alignment_strength MEDIUM, risk_level HIGH_RISK. This is a counter-trend LONG setup but risk_level HIGH_RISK requires extreme caution. 15m momentum WEAKENING + price_location LOWER_10: zone_weakening rule LOWER_10_WEAKENING applies. For LONG entry: GOOD counter-trend opportunity. However, risk_level HIGH_RISK and volume ratio 0.52 weak reduce confidence. Prefer HOLD.\n\nTRX: htf BEARISH (price=0.2839 < EMA20=0.28442, RSI 42.3, ADX 18 WEAK, structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING, price_location MIDDLE). 15m: price=0.2838, RSI 42.6, momentum WEAKENING, structure UNCLEAR, price_location LOWER_10. 3m: price=0.2839, RSI 47.3, supertrend UP. Counter-trade: htf_trend BEARISH, 15m_trend BEARISH, 3m_trend BEARISH, alignment_strength NONE, risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK. Risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK per counter-trend rules: Do NOT trade. HOLD.\n\nLINK: htf BEARISH (price=12.29 < EMA20=12.4537, RSI 34.4, ADX 38 MODERATE, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m: price=12.29, RSI 32.5, momentum WEAKENING, structure UNCLEAR, price_location LOWER_10. 3m: price=12.31, RSI 51.2, supertrend DOWN. Counter-trade: htf_trend BEARISH, 15m_trend BEARISH, 3m_trend BULLISH, alignment_strength MEDIUM, risk_level HIGH_RISK. This is a counter-trend LONG setup but risk_level HIGH_RISK. 15m momentum WEAKENING + price_location LOWER_10: zone_weakening rule LOWER_10_WEAKENING applies. For LONG entry: GOOD counter-trend opportunity. However, risk_level HIGH_RISK and volume ratio 0.57 weak reduce confidence. Prefer HOLD.\n\nSOL: htf BEARISH (price=124.15 < EMA20=125.2312, RSI 37.1, ADX 34 MODERATE, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m: price=124.15, RSI 36.9, momentum WEAKENING, structure UNCLEAR, price_location LOWER_10. 3m: price=124.39 > EMA20=124.2431, RSI 56.7, supertrend DOWN. Counter-trade: htf_trend BEARISH, 15m_trend BEARISH, 3m_trend BULLISH, alignment_strength MEDIUM, risk_level HIGH_RISK. This is a counter-trend LONG setup but risk_level HIGH_RISK. 15m momentum WEAKENING + price_location LOWER_10: zone_weakening rule LOWER_10_WEAKENING applies. For LONG entry: GOOD counter-trend opportunity. However, risk_level HIGH_RISK and volume ratio 0.94 normal but not strong. Prefer HOLD.\n\nOverall: No high-confidence setups. Counter-trade opportunities exist but with HIGH_RISK or overbought conditions. SNIPER MODE: Hold cash when no clear edge. All coins HOLD.",
