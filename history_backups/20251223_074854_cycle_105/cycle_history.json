    "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Current cycle: 1 (startup phase - observe unless exceptional setup). Position slots: SHORT_FULL (0 short slots available, 2 long slots available). Constraint: Do NOT force LONG trades unless LOW/MEDIUM_RISK. Counter-trade analysis shows most coins VERY_HIGH_RISK for counter-trend. Global regime: neutral (bearish_count=2).\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=1.8895 < EMA20=1.9069, RSI 34.7, ADX 43.6 STRONG), 15m BEARISH (RSI 36.5, structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10), 3m BEARISH (RSI 39.9). All timeframes aligned bearish with volume ratio 0.51 (WEAK). Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength NONE). Trend-following SHORT would be ideal but short slots full (0 available). Zone_weakening rule: LOWER_10 + WEAKENING = DO NOT open SHORT (trend exhausted at lows). HOLD.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13198 < EMA20=0.13244, RSI 47.2, ADX 17.0 WEAK), 15m BEARISH (RSI 40.6, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10), 3m BEARISH (RSI 33.9). All timeframes aligned bearish with volume ratio 1.28 (NORMAL). Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength NONE). Trend-following SHORT ideal but short slots full. Zone_weakening rule: LOWER_10 + STRENGTHENING = SHORT still valid but cannot execute. HOLD.\n\nTRX: 1h NEUTRAL (price=0.2843 ≈ EMA20=0.28468, RSI 42.6, ADX 24.9 WEAK), 15m BULLISH (RSI 57.0, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING), 3m BULLISH (RSI 60.3). Mixed signals: 15m+3m bullish vs 1h neutral. Counter-trade analysis: MEDIUM_RISK (alignment_strength STRONG for counter-trend LONG). Volume ratio 1.26 (NORMAL). This is a valid counter-trend LONG opportunity with MEDIUM_RISK. Long slots available (2). However, startup phase (cycle 1) suggests observe unless exceptional. Confidence not high enough (RSI 60.3 not extreme, momentum WEAKENING). HOLD.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.43 < EMA20=12.5545, RSI 40.9, ADX 23.1 WEAK), 15m BEARISH (RSI 29.7, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10), 3m BEARISH (RSI 38.1). All timeframes aligned bearish. EXISTING SHORT position: unrealized_pnl -1.23, erosion_status NONE. Reversal signals: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL (only 3m shows reversal against short). Loss_risk_signal LOW_LOSS_RISK. Volume ratio 0.07 (<0.20) - DO NOT TRADE per hard rule for new entries. For existing position: continue holding as trend still bearish, reversal weak. No exit signal.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=125.52 < EMA20=125.95, RSI 46.1, ADX 17.3 WEAK), 15m BEARISH (RSI 41.9, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10), 3m BEARISH (RSI 40.5). All timeframes aligned bearish. EXISTING SHORT position: unrealized_pnl -0.12, erosion_status NONE. Reversal signals: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL (only 3m shows reversal against short). Loss_risk_signal LOW_LOSS_RISK. Volume ratio 0.30 (WEAK). For existing position: continue holding as trend still bearish, reversal weak. No exit signal.\n\nASTER: No data in MARKET_DATA but appears in TREND_REVERSAL_DATA. 1h BEARISH, 3m NEUTRAL with INFORMATIONAL reversal. Insufficient data for analysis. HOLD.\n\nOverall: Startup phase suggests caution. Short slots full prevents new bearish entries despite strong bearish trends in XRP, DOGE, LINK, SOL. TRX offers counter-trend LONG with MEDIUM_RISK but not exceptional enough for cycle 1. Existing SHORT positions (LINK, SOL) should be held as trends remain bearish with weak reversal signals. No trades meet all constraints.",

All timeframes aligned bearish with strong volume ratio 6.6x. Counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK for LONG (alignment_strength NONE, volume_ratio 0.34 WEAK). Zone_weakening rule: LOWER_10 + WEAKENING would signal trend exhaustion, but momentum is STABLE/STRENGTHENING, so SHORT remains valid. Strong trend-following SHORT setup.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.702 < EMA20=0.7063, RSI 45.7, ADX 15.2 WEAK, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING), 15m BEARISH (RSI 40.1, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10), 3m BEARISH (RSI 45.9, supertrend DOWN). Timeframes aligned bearish with volume ratio 3.5x STRONG. Counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK for LONG (alignment_strength NONE, volume_ratio 0.36 WEAK). Zone_weakening rule: LOWER_10 + STRENGTHENING momentum means trend NOT exhausted - SHORT continues. Good trend-following SHORT setup.\n\nTRX: 1h NEUTRAL (price=0.2843 ≈ EMA20=0.2847, RSI 42.6, ADX 24.9 WEAK, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING), 15m BULLISH (RSI 52.4, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location MIDDLE), 3m BEARISH (RSI 44.0, supertrend DOWN). Mixed signals: 1h NEUTRAL/WEAKENING, 15m BULLISH but WEAKENING, 3m BEARISH. Counter-trade analysis shows HIGH_RISK for LONG (htf_trend BEARISH, 15m_trend BULLISH, alignment_strength MEDIUM, volume_ratio 0.54 WEAK). Momentum WEAKENING on both 1h and 15m reduces conviction. No clear edge - HOLD.\n\nDOGE, LINK, SOL: No market data provided. LINK and SOL are in cooldown (2 cycles) - MUST NOT trade per rules. DOGE unknown - assume HOLD.\n\nPosition slots: 0/5 used, 2 LONG slots available, 2 SHORT slots available. Cooldown status: SHORT direction has cooldown=1 (but rules say cooldown after 3 consecutive losses OR $5+ loss; here SHORT has 5 wins, 0 losses, net PnL +1.63, so likely not in cooldown - possibly a display issue). Since SHORT performance is positive, proceed with SHORT entries if justified.\n\nStartup behavior: Cycle 3 - still in observation phase per startup_behavior rule. However, strong trend-following setups exist for XRP and ASTER. Given exceptional, well-supported setups, will consider entries.\n\nConfidence assessment: XRP SHORT confidence 0.75 (strong alignment, volume, ADX). ASTER SHORT confidence 0.65 (good alignment but ADX WEAK). Both meet min_confidence 0.4.\n\nRisk management: Stop losses based on logical technical levels with 0.2% buffer.

Insufficient data for analysis; assume HOLD.\n\nASTER: Not in market data, but trend reversal data: htf BEARISH, 3m NEUTRAL, reversal_signals: 3m reversal true (strength INFORMATIONAL), loss_risk_signal MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. No position. 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL is noise per rules; continue watching. Decision: HOLD due to lack of market data and weak reversal signal.\n\nTRX: Market regime NEUTRAL, tags Vol_Low. Position: long, entry 0.2842, current 0.2842, unrealized PnL 0, erosion NONE. 1h: price=0.2843 < EMA20=0.2847, RSI 42.6, ADX 24.9 WEAK, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location MIDDLE (percentile 20). 15m: price=0.2842 < EMA20=0.2842 (approx equal), RSI 48.3, ADX 13.3 NO_TREND, structure HH_HL, momentum WEAKENING, price_location MIDDLE. 3m: price=0.2842 ≈ EMA20=0.2843, RSI 45.8, ADX 27.4 MODERATE, supertrend DOWN. Mixed signals: 1h bearish but weak, 15m no trend with weakening momentum, 3m neutral. Volume ratios: 3m 0.90 (NORMAL), but counter-trade volume_ratio 0.074 (<0.20? Not a hard rule for TRX). Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK, alignment NONE – but position is long (counter-trend per reversal data: is_counter_trend true). Risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK prohibits new trades, but existing position: check exit logic. Reversal signals: none, strength NONE. Erosion NONE. Price near support at 0.2839 (strength 2). Invalidation condition: If 1h price closes below 1h EMA20 * 0.998 = 0.2841. Current 1h price 0.2843 > 0.2841, so not invalidated. However, momentum WEAKENING on 1h and 15m, and price_location MIDDLE with RSI 42.6/48.3 not extreme. No zone_weakening combo (price_location MIDDLE). Profit target 0.2851, stop loss 0.2833. Decision: Close position? Reversal strength NONE, erosion NONE, but trend weak and counter-trade risk high. Per rules, counter-trend with VERY_HIGH_RISK should not be traded, but position exists. Since no reversal signals and not invalidated, HOLD but monitor closely.\n\nLINK: Not in market data. No position. Assume HOLD due to insufficient data.\n\nSOL: Not in market data, but trend reversal data shows BEARISH htf and 3m, no reversal signals. No position. Insufficient data; assume HOLD.\n\nOverall: Only TRX has position; others no clear edges. Counter-trade risks block XRP and TRX new entries. Short slots available 2, but no strong bearish setups with confidence >0.4. Adhere to constraints: max 5 positions, same direction limit 2 (currently 1 long, 0 short).",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Cycle 7 (220 minutes in), normal trading mode applies. Global regime neutral, but most coins bearish. Position slots: 1 long used (TRX), 1 long slot available, 2 short slots available. Counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK for all coins except ASTER (not listed), so no counter-trend entries allowed per rule. Volume ratios: XRP 0.73 (NORMAL), DOGE 0.86 (NORMAL), TRX 0.43 (WEAK), LINK 0.10 (WEAK <0.20, DO NOT TRADE per hard rule), SOL 0.53 (NORMAL). Check each coin:\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=1.8831 < EMA20=1.9063, RSI 31.4, ADX 45 STRONG, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 30.0, structure LH_LL, momentum STABLE, price_location LOWER_10). 3m BEARISH (RSI 37.0, supertrend DOWN). All timeframes aligned bearish with strong ADX. Volume NORMAL, OBV FALLING. Trend-following SHORT setup strong. Price near support at 1.9089 resistance, but trend intact. Confidence high for SHORT.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13124 < EMA20=0.13237, RSI 42.7, ADX 20 WEAK, structure LH_LL, momentum STABLE, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 35.6, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10, bb_signal OVERSOLD). 3m BEARISH (RSI 36.3, supertrend DOWN). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume NORMAL, OBV FALLING. Trend-following SHORT setup, but ADX weak indicates weaker trend. Price at LOWER_10 + RSI 35.6 not oversold (<25), so bounce risk low. Confidence moderate for SHORT.\n\nTRX: Currently LONG position (counter-trend, as 1h BEARISH). 1h BEARISH (price=0.2842 < EMA20=0.28467, RSI 41.5, ADX 25 WEAK, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING). 15m NEUTRAL (structure HH_HL but momentum WEAKENING, price_location MIDDLE, ADX 13 NO_TREND). 3m NEUTRAL (RSI 46.3, supertrend DOWN). Trend reversal data: htf_reversal true, 3m_reversal true, strength INFORMATIONAL, loss_risk_signal MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Position unrealized PnL 0, erosion_status NONE. Combined: reversal_strength INFORMATIONAL + erosion_status NONE = no exit signal per profit_erosion_rules. However, counter-trade risk VERY_HIGH_RISK, and position is counter-trend with weakening momentum. Invalidation condition: If 1h price closes below 1h EMA20 * 0.998 (0.28468 * 0.998 = 0.2841). Current price 0.2842, close to invalidation. Given high risk and near invalidation, consider closing to avoid loss. Confidence low to hold.\n\nLINK: Volume ratio 0.099 (<0.20), DO NOT TRADE per hard rule. 1h BEARISH, 15m BEARISH, 3m BEARISH. HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=125.15 < EMA20=125.92, RSI 43.3, ADX 20 WEAK, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location MIDDLE). 15m BEARISH (RSI 38.4, structure LH_LL, momentum STABLE, price_location LOWER_10). 3m BEARISH (RSI 44.4, supertrend DOWN). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume NORMAL, OBV FALLING. Trend-following SHORT setup, but ADX weak. Confidence moderate for SHORT.\n\nASTER: Not in market data, but trend reversal data shows 3m_reversal true (INFORMATIONAL), no position. No clear data for analysis, HOLD.\n\nPosition slots: Long slots available 1, short slots available 2. Counter-trend signals invalid for entries (VERY_HIGH_RISK). Trend-following SHORTs available for XRP, DOGE, SOL. Choose best edge: XRP strongest (ADX STRONG, momentum STRENGTHENING), DOGE and SOL weaker. Open SHORT on XRP, consider SHORT on DOGE or SOL if slots allow, but prioritize XRP. Close TRX LONG due to high risk and near invalidation. LINK no trade. ASTER HOLD.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Market regime is bearish (strength 0.67), with short performance strong (8 wins, 0 losses) and long performance weak (2 losses). Cooldown: long direction has 2 consecutive losses (not yet 3, so no cooldown), TRX coin in cooldown (2 cycles). Position slots: all 5 available, with 2 long and 2 short slots free. Counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK for XRP, ASTER, LINK, SOL (alignment_strength NONE, volume_strength WEAK), so counter-trend trades are prohibited per rules. Volume ratios: XRP 0.636, ASTER 0.464, LINK 0.448, SOL 0.473; all <0.20? No, they are above 0.20, so volume rule does not block trades. However, volume_strength is WEAK for all in counter-trade analysis, indicating low conviction. For each coin: XRP: 1h BEARISH (price=1.881 < EMA20=1.904, RSI 30.5, ADX 47 STRONG), 15m BEARISH (RSI 25.9, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10), 3m BEARISH (RSI 30.5, ADX 51 STRONG). All timeframes aligned bearish with strong trend. Volume ratio 1.325 on 3m (NORMAL). SuperTrend DOWN on 3m, UP on 15m/htf (conflict). Price near support? htf key_level resistance at 1.9089. Counter-trade risk VERY_HIGH_RISK, so no LONG. Trend-following SHORT setup is strong, but check zone_weakening: 15m price_location LOWER_10 + momentum STRENGTHENING, not WEAKENING, so no zone_weakening rule trigger. SHORT entry valid. ASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.699 < EMA20=0.706, RSI 43.4, ADX 15 WEAK), 15m BEARISH (RSI 32.3, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10), 3m BEARISH (RSI 30.3, ADX 40 STRONG). Alignment bearish but 1h trend weak. Volume ratio 1.115 on 3m (NORMAL). SuperTrend DOWN on 3m/15m, DOWN on htf. Counter-trade risk VERY_HIGH_RISK, so no LONG. Trend-following SHORT setup, but 1h ADX WEAK reduces confidence. Zone_weakening: 15m price_location LOWER_10 + momentum STRENGTHENING, no trigger. SHORT entry possible but lower confidence due to weak 1h trend. LINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.37 < EMA20=12.533, RSI 37.5, ADX 27 MODERATE), 15m BEARISH (RSI 20.7, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10), 3m BEARISH (RSI 21.4, ADX 61 STRONG). All aligned bearish with strong momentum. Volume ratio 2.173 on 3m (STRONG). SuperTrend DOWN on 3m, UP on 15m/htf (conflict). Counter-trade risk VERY_HIGH_RISK, so no LONG. Trend-following SHORT setup strong. Zone_weakening: 15m price_location LOWER_10 + momentum STRENGTHENING, no trigger. SHORT entry valid. SOL: 1h BEARISH (price=124.89 < EMA20=125.806, RSI 41.6, ADX 22 WEAK), 15m BEARISH (RSI 31.6, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10), 3m BEARISH (RSI 29.1, ADX 46 STRONG). Alignment bearish but 1h trend weak. Volume ratio 2.057 on 3m (STRONG). SuperTrend DOWN on 3m, UP on 15m/htf (conflict). Counter-trade risk VERY_HIGH_RISK, so no LONG. Trend-following SHORT setup, but 1h ADX WEAK reduces confidence. Zone_weakening: 15m price_location LOWER_10 + momentum STRENGTHENING, no trigger. SHORT entry possible. DOGE and TRX not in data, but TRX in cooldown per COOLDOWN_STATUS, so HOLD for TRX. DOGE not analyzed due to missing data, assume HOLD. Overall, best SHORT setups: XRP and LINK due to strong alignment and volume. ASTER and SOL weaker due to weak 1h trends. Max simultaneous positions 5, but prefer quality. Confidence thresholds: min 0.4, target high-probability setups. No existing positions to manage. Decision: Open SHORT on XRP and LINK with high confidence, HOLD others.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing, incorporating constraints and risk management.\n\nXRP: I have a SHORT position. 1h BEARISH (price=1.8803 < EMA20=1.9038, RSI 30.2, ADX 48 STRONG, structure LH_LL, momentum STABLE, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 30.2, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 3m BULLISH (RSI 48.9, price=1.8804 > EMA20=1.8797). Trend reversal data shows 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL against my short (strength INFORMATIONAL), loss_risk_signal MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK, erosion_status NONE. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level HIGH_RISK for LONG (counter-trend), volume_ratio 0.57 WEAK. Since I have a short, reversal_strength is INFORMATIONAL (only 3m reversal), and erosion_status NONE, I should hold per exit_logic (do not exit on weak 3m reversals alone). However, price_location LOWER_10 on 1h and 15m suggests near bottom with bounce risk, but RSI 30.2 not <25, so not extreme. Zone_weakening_combined_rule: LOWER_10 + momentum STRENGTHENING on 15m? 15m momentum is STRENGTHENING (bearish), not WEAKENING, so rule not triggered. But caution: price near support, reversal risk. I'll hold but monitor. Invalidation condition: If 1h price closes above 1h EMA20 * 1.002 (approx 1.9038*1.002=1.9076).\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13064 < EMA20=0.1322, RSI 39.5, ADX 22.6 WEAK, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 32.4, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 3m BEARISH (RSI 42.1, price=0.13064 < EMA20=0.1307). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume_ratio 3.49 STRONG on 3m, but counter-trade analysis shows risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK for LONG (counter-trend), volume_ratio 0.48 WEAK overall. Trend reversal data shows 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL, but no position. Since all timeframes bearish, momentum STRENGTHENING, and price_location LOWER_10 with RSI 39.5 not <25, bounce risk moderate. Zone_weakening_combined_rule: LOWER_10 + momentum STRENGTHENING on 15m? 15m momentum STRENGTHENING (bearish), not WEAKENING, so rule not triggered. However, counter-trade risk VERY_HIGH_RISK means do NOT trade counter-trend (LONG). For trend-following SHORT, alignment is strong, but price_location LOWER_10 suggests caution. I'll HOLD due to near-bottom risk and wait for better entry.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.693 < EMA20=0.7049, RSI 39.5, ADX 18.0 WEAK, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 27.7, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 3m BEARISH (RSI 32.4, price=0.692 < EMA20=0.6947). All timeframes bearish. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK for LONG, volume_ratio 0.59 WEAK. Trend reversal data shows no reversal signals. Price_location LOWER_10 on 1h and 15m, RSI 27.7 on 15m near oversold. Zone_weakening_combined_rule: LOWER_10 + momentum WEAKENING on 1h? 1h momentum WEAKENING, but 15m momentum STRENGTHENING (conflict). For SHORT entry: LOWER_10 + WEAKENING? 1h momentum WEAKENING suggests bearish trend exhausting, but 15m STRENGTHENING. Rule says for SHORT entry at LOWER_10: DO NOT open SHORT if trend exhausted at lows. Since 1h momentum WEAKENING and price_location LOWER_10, risk is high for new SHORT. I'll HOLD.\n\nTRX: 1h BEARISH (price=0.2838 < EMA20=0.2846, RSI 38.7, ADX 22.0 WEAK, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH? Price=0.2838 < EMA20=0.2842, RSI 37.9, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10. 3m BEARISH (RSI 33.4, price=0.2838 < EMA20=0.2843). All timeframes bearish. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK for LONG, volume_ratio 0.42 WEAK. Trend reversal data shows no reversal signals. Price_location LOWER_10 on 1h and 15m, RSI 33.4 on 3m not extreme. Zone_weakening_combined_rule: LOWER_10 + momentum WEAKENING on 1h? Similar to ASTER, 1h momentum WEAKENING suggests exhaustion. For SHORT entry: avoid at LOWER_10. I'll HOLD.\n\nLINK: Not in market data, but in TREND_REVERSAL_DETECTION: has_position false, reversal_signals: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL, loss_risk_signal MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK, current_trend_htf BEARISH, current_trend_3m NEUTRAL. COOLDOWN_STATUS shows coin_cooldowns: LINK:1, so LINK is in cooldown for 1 cycle. Per rules, MUST NOT propose trades for LINK. I'll HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=124.42 < EMA20=125.76, RSI 38.7, ADX 22.8 WEAK, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 34.0, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 3m BEARISH (RSI 36.6, price=124.42 < EMA20=124.61). All timeframes bearish. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK for LONG, volume_ratio 0.62 WEAK. Trend reversal data shows 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL, loss_risk_signal LOW_LOSS_RISK. Price_location LOWER_10 on 1h and 15m, RSI 34.0 on 15m not extreme. Zone_weakening_combined_rule: LOWER_10 + momentum WEAKENING on 1h? 1h momentum WEAKENING, 15m STRENGTHENING. For SHORT entry: avoid at LOWER_10 due to exhaustion risk. I'll HOLD.\n\nOverall: Market regime bearish, short performance better than long. Position slots: short_slots_available=1, long_slots_available=2. I have one short in XRP. No clear high-probability setups due to price_location LOWER_10 across most coins, suggesting near-term bounce risk. Adhere to SNIPER MODE: only trade high-probability setups. Hold cash when no clear edge. For XRP, hold position as reversal signals weak.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis of all assets using multi-timeframe approach. Cycle 28, 304 minutes in - normal trading mode applies.\n\nGLOBAL CONTEXT: Market regime BEARISH (strength 0.83), 5 bearish coins, 1 neutral. No positions open, all slots available (5 total, 2 long/2 short each). No cooldowns active. Short performance better than long (PI 34.2 vs 0).\n\nDOGE ANALYSIS:\n- 1h (HTF): BEARISH (price=0.13088 < EMA20=0.13208, RSI 41.05, ADX 24.5 WEAK). Structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10 (3%).\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.13026 < EMA20=0.13141, RSI 31.8). Structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10 (0%). ADX 52.9 STRONG.\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.13026 < EMA20=0.13069, RSI 33.8). Volume ratio 0.46 WEAK, ADX 28.8 MODERATE.\n- ALIGNMENT: All timeframes BEARISH - maximum bearish alignment. Volume weak but trend strong on 15m. Counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK for LONG (alignment_strength NONE). Zone_weakening rule: LOWER_10 + WEAKENING on 1h + STRENGTHENING on 15m = trend exhaustion at lows. For SHORT entry: DO NOT open SHORT per zone_weakening rule. For LONG entry: GOOD counter-trend opportunity if conditions align, but risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK prohibits counter-trend LONG. HOLD.\n\nASTER ANALYSIS:\n- 1h (HTF): BEARISH (price=0.693 < EMA20=0.70372, RSI 39.89, ADX 19.7 WEAK). Structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10 (9%).\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.69 < EMA20=0.69899, RSI 28.14). Structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10 (0%). ADX 67.8 STRONG.\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.69 < EMA20=0.69315, RSI 32.49). Volume ratio 0.96 NORMAL, ADX 25.8 MODERATE.\n- ALIGNMENT: All timeframes BEARISH. Volume normal, strong ADX on 15m. Counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK for LONG. Zone_weakening rule similar to DOGE: LOWER_10 + WEAKENING on 1h + STRENGTHENING on 15m = trend exhaustion at lows. For SHORT entry: DO NOT open SHORT. For LONG entry: GOOD counter-trend opportunity but risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK prohibits. HOLD.\n\nSOL ANALYSIS:\n- 1h (HTF): BEARISH (price=124.4 < EMA20=125.624, RSI 38.84, ADX 25.2 MODERATE). Structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10 (2%).\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=123.87 < EMA20=124.987, RSI 28.54). Structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10 (0%). ADX 69.1 STRONG.\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=123.88 < EMA20=124.438, RSI 29.02). Volume ratio 5.7 STRONG, bb_signal OVERSOLD, ADX 33.8 MODERATE.\n- ALIGNMENT: All timeframes BEARISH with strong volume (5.7x). Counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK for LONG. Zone_weakening rule: LOWER_10 + WEAKENING on 1h + STRENGTHENING on 15m = trend exhaustion at lows. For SHORT entry: DO NOT open SHORT. For LONG entry: GOOD counter-trend opportunity but risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK prohibits. However, 3m bb_signal OVERSOLD suggests potential bounce. Still, risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK overrides. HOLD.\n\nXRP, LINK, TRX: No data provided in MARKET_DATA - assume not available for trading this cycle.\n\nDECISION RATIONALE: All three coins show strong bearish alignment but are at LOWER_10 zones with 1h momentum WEAKENING and 15m momentum STRENGTHENING - classic exhaustion pattern. Zone_weakening rule explicitly prohibits SHORT entries at LOWER_10 when momentum is WEAKENING. Counter-trade LONG opportunities exist but have VERY_HIGH_RISK per counter-trade analysis (alignment_strength NONE, conditions met only 2). System rules prohibit trading at VERY_HIGH_RISK. Therefore, HOLD all coins. No high-confidence setups meeting minimum 0.4 confidence threshold.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis across all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish (strength 0.83), with all coins in BEARISH market regimes. No positions open, all slots available. Counter-trade analysis shows high to very high risk for counter-trend trades; per rules, avoid VERY_HIGH_RISK and HIGH_RISK requires caution. Volume ratios checked: all above 0.2, so no hard volume rule violations. Startup behavior: cycle 29, normal trading mode applies. Evaluate each coin for trend-following SHORT opportunities (aligned with bearish regimes) or counter-trend LONG if low risk.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=1.8841 < EMA20=1.9021, RSI 32.9, ADX 51 STRONG, structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (price=1.8795 < EMA20=1.8870, RSI 34.8, ADX 47 STRONG, structure LH_LL, momentum STABLE). 3m BULLISH (price=1.882 > EMA20=1.8819, RSI 49.8, ADX 36 MODERATE). Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish - mixed signals. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level HIGH_RISK, alignment_strength MEDIUM, volume_ratio 0.56 WEAK. Per counter_trend rules: HIGH_RISK requires extreme caution; do not trade if risk_level is VERY_HIGH_RISK, but HIGH_RISK is allowed if confidence > 0.65? Checking: confidence threshold for counter-trend is 0.65, but risk_level rules say HIGH_RISK: 'Evaluate carefully, prefer HOLD.' Given volume weak and mixed alignment, prefer HOLD. No strong trend-following SHORT due to 3m bullish reversal? 3m bullish but 15m+1h bearish, momentum STABLE, price_location LOWER_10 + RSI 32.9 suggests bounce risk? LOWER_10 + RSI<25 indicates bounce probability, but RSI 32.9 not <25, so moderate. Zone_weakening rule: LOWER_10 + WEAKENING? 1h momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10. For SHORT entry: DO NOT open SHORT if LOWER_10 WEAKENING (trend exhausted at lows). Prefer HOLD or evaluate LONG. But counter-trend LONG is HIGH_RISK, so HOLD. Decision: HOLD.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13088 < EMA20=0.13208, RSI 41.0, ADX 24 WEAK, structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (price=0.13026 < EMA20=0.13141, RSI 31.8, ADX 53 STRONG, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 3m BEARISH (price=0.13025 < EMA20=0.13063, RSI 35.8, ADX 35 MODERATE). Alignment: all timeframes bearish with 15m momentum STRENGTHENING. Strong trend-following SHORT setup. Volume ratio 14.18 STRONG confirms conviction. Price_location LOWER_10 + RSI 31.8: RSI not <25, but LOWER_10 WEAKENING? 1h momentum WEAKENING, but 15m STRENGTHENING, so trend may be accelerating downward. Zone_weakening rule: LOWER_10 WEAKENING for SHORT entry: DO NOT open SHORT (trend exhausted at lows). However, 15m momentum is STRENGTHENING, not WEAKENING, so this rule may not apply strictly? Rule says 'Zone + WEAKENING combination', but 15m momentum is STRENGTHENING, 1h is WEAKENING. Since 15m is more relevant for entry, and it's STRENGTHENING, trend may not be exhausted. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK, so avoid counter-trend LONG. Given strong bearish alignment and volume, SHORT is valid but caution due to LOWER_10. Confidence moderate. Set stop above recent resistance.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.693 < EMA20=0.7037, RSI 39.9, ADX 20 WEAK, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (price=0.69 < EMA20=0.69899, RSI 28.1, ADX 68 STRONG, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 3m BEARISH (price=0.692 < EMA20=0.69313, RSI 42.0, ADX 24 WEAK). Alignment: all bearish, 15m momentum STRENGTHENING. Trend-following SHORT opportunity. Volume ratio 0.71 NORMAL. Price_location LOWER_10 + RSI 28.1: RSI <25? 28.1 not <25, but close. LOWER_10 WEAKENING? 1h WEAKENING, 15m STRENGTHENING. Similar to DOGE, caution but SHORT possible. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK, avoid LONG. Confidence moderate.\n\nTRX: 1h BEARISH (price=0.2836 < EMA20=0.28452, RSI 37.1, ADX 22 WEAK, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (price=0.2837 < EMA20=0.28415, RSI 37.2, ADX 34 MODERATE, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 3m BEARISH (price=0.2838 < EMA20=0.28391, RSI 44.8, ADX 48 STRONG). Alignment: all bearish, 15m momentum STRENGTHENING. Trend-following SHORT. Volume ratio 0.34 WEAK (but >0.2, so okay). Price_location LOWER_10 + RSI 37.1: no extreme oversold. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK, avoid LONG. Confidence moderate.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=124.4 < EMA20=125.624, RSI 38.8, ADX 25 MODERATE, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (price=123.87 < EMA20=124.987, RSI 28.5, ADX 69 STRONG, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 3m BEARISH (price=123.98 < EMA20=124.392, RSI 34.0, ADX 37 MODERATE). Alignment: all bearish, 15m momentum STRENGTHENING. Strong trend-following SHORT. Volume ratio 0.92 NORMAL. Price_location LOWER_10 + RSI 28.5: RSI not <25. Counter-trade analysis: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK, avoid LONG. Confidence high due to strong ADX and alignment.\n\nOverall, best SHORT setups: DOGE, ASTER, TRX, SOL. XRP mixed, HOLD. Position slots: 5 available, short_slots_available 2, but we can open up to 5 positions total. Choose highest confidence: SOL (strong trend), DOGE (strong volume), ASTER (moderate), TRX (moderate). Limit to 2 SHORTs per same_direction_limit? Rule: same_direction_limit 2, meaning if 2 SHORTs, cannot open another SHORT. We have 0 SHORTs, so can open up to 2. To maximize, open 2 SHORTs with highest confidence: SOL and DOGE. Set stops and targets based on technical levels.\n\nConfidence thresholds: min_confidence 0.4, all above. Invalidation with 0.2% buffer.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Systematic analysis across all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum, and 3m entry timing. Market regime is bearish (strength 0.83), with 2 short positions open (DOGE and SOL). Short slots are full (0 available), long slots available (2). Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE - do NOT force LONG trades unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK; high confidence alone is insufficient. Counter-trade analysis shows HIGH_RISK for XRP (counter-trend LONG opportunity) but short slots full, so cannot execute; trend-following SHORT invalidated per constraint instruction. Volume ratios for XRP, DOGE, SOL in counter-trade analysis are all <0.5 (weak), indicating low conviction for counter-trend moves. Reversal signals are INFORMATIONAL (3m only) for all coins, not strong enough to close positions. No cooldowns active. Startup behavior: cycle 30, normal trading mode.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=1.8841 < EMA20=1.9021, RSI 32.9, ADX 51 STRONG, structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (price=1.8795 < EMA20=1.8870, RSI 34.8, ADX 47 STRONG, structure LH_LL, momentum STABLE). 3m BULLISH (price=1.8833 > EMA20=1.8822, RSI 52.2, ADX 28 MODERATE, volume_ratio 1.57 STRONG). Counter-trade analysis: risk_level HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength MEDIUM, conditions total_met 2, volume_ratio 0.40 WEAK). Per counter_trend rules: HIGH_RISK requires extreme caution; confidence threshold 0.65 not met (no confidence provided). Short slots full, so cannot open LONG per constraint (counter-trend signal invalidates trend-following SHORT). HOLD.\n\nDOGE: Has SHORT position (unrealized PnL -1.05, confidence 0.55, erosion_status NONE). 1h BEARISH (price=0.13088 < EMA20=0.1321, RSI 41.0, ADX 24 WEAK, structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (price=0.13026 < EMA20=0.1314, RSI 31.8, ADX 53 STRONG, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 3m BEARISH (price=0.13045 < EMA20=0.1306, RSI 43.3, ADX 38 MODERATE, volume_ratio 1.29 NORMAL). Counter-trade analysis: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength NONE, conditions total_met 2, volume_ratio 0.27 WEAK). Per counter_trend rules: VERY_HIGH_RISK - do NOT trade. Reversal signals: INFORMATIONAL (3m reversal true, strength INFORMATIONAL). Loss_risk_signal MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. No strong reversal (15m+3m both reversal required for STRONG). Erosion_status NONE, so no profit erosion. Continue holding SHORT.\n\nASTER: No market data provided. Assume HOLD due to lack of information.\n\nTRX: No market data provided. Assume HOLD due to lack of information.\n\nLINK: No market data provided. Assume HOLD due to lack of information.\n\nSOL: Has SHORT position (unrealized PnL -0.50, confidence 0.51, erosion_status NONE). 1h BEARISH (price=124.4 < EMA20=125.6, RSI 38.8, ADX 25 MODERATE, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (price=123.87 < EMA20=124.99, RSI 28.5, ADX 69 STRONG, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 3m BEARISH (price=124.23 < EMA20=124.37, RSI 43.5, ADX 30 MODERATE, volume_ratio 1.83 STRONG). Counter-trade analysis: risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength NONE, conditions total_met 1, volume_ratio 0.19 WEAK). Per counter_trend rules: VERY_HIGH_RISK - do NOT trade. Reversal signals: INFORMATIONAL (3m reversal true, strength INFORMATIONAL). Loss_risk_signal LOW_LOSS_RISK. No strong reversal. Erosion_status NONE. Continue holding SHORT.\n\nOverall: No new entries due to short slots full and counter-trend opportunities too risky or invalidated. Maintain existing positions.",

Counter-trade analysis: HIGH_RISK (MEDIUM alignment, 2 conditions met). Volume ratio 0.33 WEAK. 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL (no position). Trend-following SHORT setup: 1h+15m aligned bearish with strong ADX, but 3m bullish creates conflict. Counter-trend LONG: HIGH_RISK per rules - requires confidence >0.65, but current setup lacks strong alignment. Price at LOWER_10 + RSI 32.9 suggests bounce risk, but momentum WEAKENING on both 1h/15m indicates continued weakness.

EXISTING SHORT POSITION: unrealized PnL -1.42, erosion_status NONE. Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (NONE alignment) - do NOT trade per rules. 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL (against short position).

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Market regime is strongly bearish (0.83 strength). Position slots: 1 short position (DOGE), 4 slots available (2 long, 1 short). No cooldowns active. Startup caution no longer applies (cycle 35).\n\nDOGE: Currently have SHORT position with -1.05 PnL. 1h BEARISH (price=0.13088 < EMA20=0.13208, RSI 41.0, ADX 24.5 WEAK, structure LH_LL, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 34.9, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 3m BEARISH (RSI 43.5). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 0.15x (<0.20) - DO NOT TRADE per hard rule. Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength NONE). Trend reversal: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL only. Erosion_status NONE. Position is losing but trend still bearish. Volume too low to add. HOLD position.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.693 < EMA20=0.70372, RSI 39.9, ADX 19.7 WEAK, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 38.2, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING). 3m BULLISH (RSI 52.0). Mixed signals: 1h+15m bearish, 3m bullish. Counter-trade analysis: HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength MEDIUM). Volume ratio 0.40x (WEAK). According to counter-trend rules: HIGH_RISK requires extreme caution. Do NOT trade if risk_level is VERY_HIGH_RISK. HIGH_RISK is borderline but allowed with confidence >0.65. However, volume_strength WEAK and no strong edge. HOLD.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.34 < EMA20=12.51, RSI 36.9, ADX 30.8 MODERATE, structure UNCLEAR, momentum STABLE, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 35.8, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING). 3m BULLISH (RSI 50.9). Mixed signals similar to ASTER. Counter-trade analysis: HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength MEDIUM). Volume ratio 0.50x (WEAK). Volume_strength WEAK reduces confidence. No clear edge. HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=124.4 < EMA20=125.62, RSI 38.8, ADX 25.2 MODERATE, structure UNCLEAR, momentum WEAKENING, price_location LOWER_10). 15m BEARISH (RSI 34.8, structure LH_LL, momentum STRENGTHENING, price_location LOWER_10). 3m BEARISH (RSI 43.9). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 0.41x (WEAK). Counter-trade analysis: VERY_HIGH_RISK (alignment_strength NONE). According to counter-trend rules: Do NOT trade if risk_level is VERY_HIGH_RISK. Volume_strength WEAK. No clear edge. HOLD.\n\nXRP: Not in market data but in trend reversal detection. 1h BEARISH, 3m NEUTRAL. No position. Trend reversal: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL only. No data for full analysis. HOLD.\n\nTRX: Not in market data but in trend reversal detection. 1h BEARISH, 3m NEUTRAL. No position. Trend reversal: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL only. No data for full analysis. HOLD.\n\nOverall: Global bearish regime. Most coins show bearish trends but with weak volume or mixed signals. No high-confidence setups. Maintain discipline: SNIPER MODE - only trade high-probability setups. Holding cash is valid.",
