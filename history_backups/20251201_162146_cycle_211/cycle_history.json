    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish with all coins in bearish market regimes. Position slots: 1 short position open (LINK), with 3 available slots (2 long, 1 short). No directional cooldowns. Counter-trade analysis is empty, indicating no strong counter-trend signals. Trend reversal data shows 3m reversals for several coins but mostly MEDIUM or INFORMATIONAL strength, not strong enough for entries. Volume analysis: ASTER has weak volume (ratio 0.168), DO NOT TRADE per rules. Others have normal or strong volume. For each coin: XRP: 1h bearish (price=2.0184 < EMA=2.0731, RSI=24.4), 15m bearish (price=2.0228 < EMA=2.0314, RSI=39.2), 3m bullish (price=2.0228 > EMA=2.0196, RSI=53.4). Mixed signals; 3m bullish but 1h and 15m bearish, no strong alignment. Volume normal. No clear edge, hold. DOGE: 1h bearish (price=0.1353 < EMA=0.1396, RSI=20.1), 15m bearish (price=0.1354 < EMA=0.1364, RSI=32.8), 3m neutral (price=0.1354 ≈ EMA=0.1354, RSI=47.7). All timeframes bearish or neutral, no bullish alignment. Volume normal. No clear edge, hold. ASTER: 1h bearish (price=0.929 < EMA=0.9962, RSI=18.7), 15m bearish (price=0.928 < EMA=0.9598, RSI=22.9), 3m bearish (price=0.928 < EMA=0.9296, RSI=43.1). All timeframes bearish, but volume ratio=0.168 (weakness warning: <=0.20x average, DO NOT TRADE per hard rule). Skip. ADA: 1h bearish (price=0.3786 < EMA=0.3920, RSI=23.9), 15m bearish (price=0.3793 < EMA=0.3816, RSI=37.2), 3m bullish (price=0.3793 > EMA=0.3789, RSI=52.1). Mixed signals; 3m bullish but 1h and 15m bearish, no strong alignment. Volume normal. No clear edge, hold. LINK: Existing short position. 1h bearish (price=12.06 < EMA=12.3714, RSI=25.6), 15m bearish (price=12.05 < EMA=12.1148, RSI=38.3), 3m bearish (price=12.05 < EMA=12.0634, RSI=44.7). All timeframes bearish, supporting short. Volume strong. Reversal signals: 3m reversal true but strength=INFORMATIONAL, loss_risk_signal=LOW_LOSS_RISK. Per exit logic, 3m reversal alone is weak; continue monitoring but no need to close. Hold position. SOL: 1h bearish (price=126.67 < EMA=129.224, RSI=28.7), 15m bearish (price=126.48 < EMA=126.8986, RSI=43.0), 3m bearish (price=126.48 < EMA=126.6126, RSI=45.3). All timeframes bearish with alignment. Volume normal. Strong trend-following SHORT setup. Short slots available=1, so execute. Confidence high due to alignment. Overall, no strong counter-trend opportunities (risk levels not LOW_RISK per counter-trade analysis). Discipline: hold cash when no clear edge. Only SOL offers a clear SHORT edge.",

No clear edge.\n\nLINK: Existing SHORT position. 1h BEARISH (price=12.06 < EMA20=12.3714, RSI=25.6), 15m BEARISH (price=12.02 < EMA20=12.1049, RSI=35.5), 3m BEARISH (price=12.05 < EMA20=12.0560, RSI=46.8). All timeframes aligned bearish supporting SHORT. Volume ratio=0.154 (WEAK, <0.20x). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal strength=INFORMATIONAL against position (since position is short, 3m reversal bullish would be against). Strength=INFORMATIONAL (only 3m shows reversal) - according to rules: 'Only 3m shows reversal against position. Continue monitoring, don't overreact to noise.' Position has unrealized PnL=0.10608 (positive). No invalidation (price still below 1h EMA20=12.41).

All timeframes aligned bearish supporting SHORT. Volume ratio=0.239 (WEAK, 0.20-0.50x). TREND_REVERSAL shows no reversal signals. Position has unrealized PnL=0.1559561 (positive). No invalidation (price still below 1h EMA20=129.224). HOLD.\n\nPOSITION_SLOTS: short_slots_available=0 (SHORT_FULL), long_slots_available=2.

No counter-trade opportunities identified (COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS empty). All coins have weak volume (<0.50x), reducing confidence. No valid setups meet criteria.\n\nGLOBAL: Market regime BEARISH (bearish_count=6). No cooldowns active. Short performance has 1 loss but not in cooldown (needs 3 consecutive losses or $5+ loss).\n\nCONCLUSION: All coins show weak volume, most have mixed or bearish signals. No high-confidence setups.

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish with all coins except XRP in bearish or neutral regimes. Position slots: 1 short position (SOL), 1 short slot available, 2 long slots available. Cooldowns: LINK in coin cooldown, no directional cooldowns. Counter-trade analysis empty. Trend reversal data shows all coins have 3m reversal signals with MEDIUM strength, but only applies to existing positions; SOL has a short position with 3m reversal against it (BULLISH), but strength is MEDIUM (only 3m reversal), so do not overreact. Volume analysis: XRP volume strong, others normal; no volume weakness warnings. Evaluate each coin for LONG or SHORT entries based on strongest quantified edge, respecting constraints.\n\nXRP: Market regime NEUTRAL. 1h BEARISH (price=2.0184 < EMA20=2.0731, RSI=24.4 oversold). 15m NEUTRAL (price=2.0338 > EMA20=2.0315, RSI=48.8). 3m BULLISH (price=2.0467 > EMA20=2.0260, RSI=74.4 overbought). Alignment: 1h bearish, 15m neutral, 3m bullish – mixed signals. Volume strong (ratio=2.72). Open Interest high, funding slightly negative. Counter-trend opportunity: 1h bearish, but 3m bullish suggests potential LONG counter-trend. Risk level: 15m neutral, 3m bullish with strong volume – MEDIUM_RISK (Tier 2). Confidence >0.65? RSI overbought at 74.4 reduces confidence; estimated confidence 0.6. Since risk_level is MEDIUM_RISK and confidence <0.65, do not trade. No clear edge; HOLD.\n\nDOGE: Market regime BEARISH. 1h BEARISH (price=0.13526 < EMA20=0.1396, RSI=20.1 oversold). 15m BEARISH (price=0.13526 < EMA20=0.1362, RSI=31.0). 3m BULLISH (price=0.1362 > EMA20=0.1354, RSI=63.8). Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish – mixed. Volume normal (ratio=1.25). Funding negative. Counter-trend: 1h bearish, 3m bullish suggests LONG counter-trend. Risk level: 15m bearish, 3m bullish – MEDIUM_RISK. Confidence: RSI 63.8 not extreme, but 15m bearish reduces confidence; estimated 0.55. Since confidence <0.65, do not trade. HOLD.\n\nASTER: Market regime BEARISH. 1h BEARISH (price=0.929 < EMA20=0.9962, RSI=18.7 oversold). 15m BEARISH (price=0.934 < EMA20=0.9548, RSI=30.3). 3m BULLISH (price=0.938 > EMA20=0.9313, RSI=59.3). Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish – mixed. Volume normal (ratio=0.60). Funding slightly positive. Counter-trend: LONG opportunity. Risk level: MEDIUM_RISK. Confidence: RSI 59.3 moderate, but 15m bearish; estimated 0.5. Confidence <0.65, do not trade. HOLD.\n\nADA: Market regime BEARISH. 1h BEARISH (price=0.3786 < EMA20=0.3920, RSI=23.9 oversold). 15m NEUTRAL (price=0.381 ≈ EMA20=0.3815, RSI=44.1). 3m BULLISH (price=0.3838 > EMA20=0.3801, RSI=71.8 overbought). Alignment: 1h bearish, 15m neutral, 3m bullish – mixed. Volume normal (ratio=1.24). Funding negative. Counter-trend: LONG opportunity. Risk level: MEDIUM_RISK. Confidence: RSI overbought at 71.8 reduces confidence; estimated 0.55. Confidence <0.65, do not trade. HOLD.\n\nLINK: Market regime BEARISH. 1h BEARISH (price=12.06 < EMA20=12.3714, RSI=25.6 oversold). 15m NEUTRAL (price=12.11 ≈ EMA20=12.1114, RSI=47.2). 3m BULLISH (price=12.2 > EMA20=12.0834, RSI=72.1 overbought). Alignment: Mixed. Volume normal (ratio=1.13). Funding negative. Counter-trend: LONG opportunity. Risk level: MEDIUM_RISK. Confidence: RSI overbought at 72.1 reduces confidence; estimated 0.5. However, COIN COOLDOWN active (LINK:1) – MUST NOT propose any trades for LINK. HOLD.\n\nSOL: Market regime BEARISH. 1h BEARISH (price=126.67 < EMA20=129.224, RSI=28.7). 15m BEARISH (price=126.09 < EMA20=126.7765, RSI=40.0). 3m BULLISH (price=126.98 > EMA20=126.4831, RSI=58.4). Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish – mixed. Volume strong (ratio=1.60). Funding negative. Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL -0.78. Trend reversal data: 3m reversal BULLISH against position with MEDIUM strength. According to exit logic, MEDIUM reversal (only 3m) – continue monitoring, don't overreact to noise. Invalidation condition: 1h price closes above EMA20 (129.224) – not met. PnL negative but not at hard margin stop loss (3%). Hold position. No new entry due to mixed signals and existing position.\n\nOverall: No high-confidence setups. All coins show mixed signals with 3m bullish reversals but 1h bearish trends, leading to MEDIUM_RISK counter-trend opportunities with confidence below 0.65. Respect constraints: LINK in cooldown, position slots available but no valid trades. Maintain discipline; holding cash is superior.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish (6 bearish, 0 bullish). Position slots: 1 short used (SOL), 1 short slot available, 2 long slots available. No cooldowns active. Counter-trade analysis empty. Trend reversal data shows 3m reversals for XRP, DOGE, ASTER, ADA, LINK (strength MEDIUM, loss risk MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK) but no positions in these coins; for SOL (short position), 3m reversal strength INFORMATIONAL, loss risk LOW_LOSS_RISK. Apply constraints: min confidence 0.4, volume ratio >0.20x, avoid high-risk counter-trends. Evaluate each coin:\n\nXRP: Market regime NEUTRAL. 1h bearish (price=2.0184 < EMA20=2.0731, RSI=24.4), 15m bearish (price=2.0338 < EMA20=2.0315, RSI=48.8), 3m bullish (price=2.0353 > EMA20=2.0265, RSI=61.2). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume ratio 1.45x (NORMAL). No clear edge; trend-following short not aligned (1h bearish but 3m bullish), counter-trend long risk level not provided (counter-trade analysis empty), but 3m reversal strength MEDIUM suggests caution. Confidence low. Hold.\n\nDOGE: Market regime BEARISH. 1h bearish (price=0.13526 < EMA20=0.1396, RSI=20.1), 15m bearish (price=0.13526 < EMA20=0.1362, RSI=31.0), 3m neutral (price=0.13549 ≈ EMA20=0.1354, RSI=50.4). All timeframes bearish or neutral. Volume ratio 0.93x (NORMAL). Trend-following short setup: 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m neutral but not bullish. Confidence moderate (0.6). Short slots available (1). Target 0.133 (below support), stop 0.137 (above recent high). Invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20 (0.1396).\n\nASTER: Market regime BEARISH. 1h bearish (price=0.929 < EMA20=0.9962, RSI=18.7), 15m bearish (price=0.934 < EMA20=0.9548, RSI=30.3), 3m neutral (price=0.931 ≈ EMA20=0.931, RSI=48.1). All timeframes bearish or neutral. Volume ratio 0.70x (NORMAL). Trend-following short setup: 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m neutral. Confidence moderate (0.6). Short slots available (1). Target 0.915 (below support), stop 0.945 (above recent high). Invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20 (0.9962).\n\nADA: Market regime BEARISH. 1h bearish (price=0.3786 < EMA20=0.392, RSI=23.9), 15m bearish (price=0.381 < EMA20=0.3815, RSI=44.1), 3m bullish (price=0.3817 > EMA20=0.3802, RSI=59.8). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume ratio 0.86x (NORMAL). No clear edge; trend-following short not aligned, counter-trend long risk level not provided. Confidence low. Hold.\n\nLINK: Market regime BEARISH. 1h bearish (price=12.06 < EMA20=12.3714, RSI=25.6), 15m bearish (price=12.11 < EMA20=12.1114, RSI=47.2), 3m bullish (price=12.12 > EMA20=12.086, RSI=55.9). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume ratio 0.82x (NORMAL). No clear edge; trend-following short not aligned, counter-trend long risk level not provided. Confidence low. Hold.\n\nSOL: Market regime BEARISH. Existing short position. 1h bearish (price=126.67 < EMA20=129.224, RSI=28.7), 15m bearish (price=126.09 < EMA20=126.7765, RSI=40.0), 3m bearish (price=126.38 < EMA20=126.4518, RSI=47.8). All timeframes bearish, supporting short. Trend reversal data: 3m reversal strength INFORMATIONAL (against short), loss risk LOW_LOSS_RISK. Unrealized PnL -0.1132613 (negative). Exit logic: reversal warning applies; 3m reversal against position but strength INFORMATIONAL (only 3m shows reversal, 15m does not). Do not overreact to noise; continue monitoring. Hold position, maintain exit plan.\n\nOverall: Propose shorts for DOGE and ASTER as trend-following setups with aligned timeframes. Avoid longs due to mixed signals or lack of counter-trade analysis. Maintain SOL short.",

Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE, so only propose LONG entries if they are LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence. Counter-trade analysis is empty, but TREND_REVERSAL_DATA indicates some 3m reversals. Cooldowns: none active. Volume ratios: all normal or strong except ASTER has strong volume. Risk management: maintain at least 1:1.3 risk-reward, use 1h ATR for stops, and avoid trades with confidence <0.4.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=2.0184 < EMA20=2.0731, RSI=24.4), 15m BEARISH (price=2.0307 < EMA20=2.0313, RSI=46.3), 3m BULLISH (price=2.0287 > EMA20=2.0279, RSI=52.0). 3m reversal strength MEDIUM. Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Counter-trend LONG opportunity? 3m bullish but 1h bearish, so counter-trend direction is LONG (3m direction). Risk level from reversal data: MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. According to counter-trend rules, MEDIUM_RISK requires confidence >0.65. Confidence: 3m bullish with RSI 52.0, MACD positive, volume ratio 0.74x (normal). Not strong enough for >0.65 confidence. Also, short slots full, so cannot open SHORT. Hold.\n\nDOGE: Has SHORT position. 1h BEARISH (price=0.13526 < EMA20=0.1396, RSI=20.1), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13512 < EMA20=0.1361, RSI=29.8), 3m BEARISH (price=0.13497 < EMA20=0.1354, RSI=42.4). 3m reversal strength INFORMATIONAL. All timeframes aligned bearish. Position is profitable (unrealized PnL positive). No reversal signals strong enough to close (only 3m INFORMATIONAL).

Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Counter-trend LONG opportunity? 3m bullish, so direction LONG. Risk level: MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Confidence: 3m bullish with RSI 52.0, MACD positive, volume ratio 3.09x (strong). This could support higher confidence, but need >0.65. Volume is strong, but 1h trend strongly bearish. Confidence estimated ~0.6, below threshold. Also, short slots full, so cannot open SHORT. Hold.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3786 < EMA20=0.3920, RSI=23.9), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3809 < EMA20=0.3814, RSI=43.8), 3m BULLISH (price=0.3806 > EMA20=0.3804, RSI=52.2). 3m reversal strength MEDIUM. Alignment: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Counter-trend LONG opportunity? 3m bullish, so direction LONG. Risk level: MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Confidence: 3m bullish with RSI 52.2, MACD positive, volume ratio 0.60x (normal). Not strong enough for >0.65 confidence. Also, short slots full, so cannot open SHORT. Hold.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.06 < EMA20=12.3714, RSI=25.6), 15m BEARISH (price=12.1 < EMA20=12.1095, RSI=45.9), 3m BEARISH (price=12.08 < EMA20=12.0903, RSI=48.8). 3m reversal strength INFORMATIONAL. All timeframes aligned bearish. Short slots full, so cannot open SHORT. No counter-trend opportunity. Hold.\n\nSOL: Has SHORT position. 1h BEARISH (price=126.67 < EMA20=129.224, RSI=28.7), 15m BEARISH (price=125.91 < EMA20=126.6966, RSI=38.3), 3m BEARISH (price=125.86 < EMA20=126.3531, RSI=39.9). 3m reversal strength NONE. All timeframes aligned bearish. Position is profitable (unrealized PnL positive). No reversal signals. Hold position.\n\nOverall: No high-confidence LONG setups due to low confidence in counter-trend opportunities. SHORT slots are full, so no new SHORT entries. Maintain existing positions and hold cash for better opportunities.",

Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.61 (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM, current_trend_3m=BULLISH, but 1h BEARISH. This is a counter-trend LONG opportunity (3m bullish vs. 1h bearish). Risk_level from COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS is not provided, but reversal signals indicate MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. According to counter_trend rules, if risk_level is MEDIUM_RISK, execute if confidence > 0.65. Confidence is moderate due to 3m alignment and volume, but 1h bearish pressure. Confidence estimated at 0.6. However, POSITION_SLOTS: short_slots_available=0, long_slots_available=2. Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE, instruction: do NOT force trades in other direction unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. This is MEDIUM_RISK, so LONG is allowed.

Volume is weak (ratio <= 0.50x), reduce confidence significantly. According to volume rules, if volume ratio is 0.20-0.50x, reduce confidence. Here ratio=0.44, so confidence low. No clear edge.

All three timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 0.30x (WEAK) - below 0.50x threshold reduces confidence. Open Interest 237M, funding rate slightly negative. No reversal signals. SHORT trend-following setup but volume weak. SHORT slots full (2/2 used), cannot open new SHORT positions per constraint. No counter-trend LONG opportunity identified.\n\nDOGE: Currently have SHORT position (unrealized PnL +0.326). 1h BEARISH (price=0.1351 < EMA20=0.1391, RSI=20.1), 15m BEARISH (price=0.1350 < EMA20=0.1360, RSI=29.0), 3m BEARISH (price=0.1350 < EMA20=0.1352, RSI=46.3).

Mixed signals: 1h+15m bearish, 3m bullish. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m_reversal=true with strength=INFORMATIONAL (only 3m shows reversal). This is counter-trend LONG opportunity (direction opposite to 1h trend). Risk_level from COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS not provided, but based on signals: 3m alignment only (not 15m+3m), volume ratio 0.21x (WEAK, below 0.50x). This appears MEDIUM_RISK at best. Confidence would need >0.65 to execute counter-trend. Current confidence low due to weak volume and only 3m alignment. SHORT slots full, but counter-trend LONG invalidates trend-following SHORT. No clear edge.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.11 < EMA20=12.35, RSI=29.5), 15m BEARISH (price=12.10 < EMA20=12.1086, RSI=45.9), 3m BULLISH (price=12.10 > EMA20=12.0943, RSI=51.1). Mixed signals similar to ADA. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m_reversal=true with strength=INFORMATIONAL. Counter-trend LONG opportunity. Volume ratio 0.18x (WEAK, below 0.20x hard rule) - DO NOT TRADE per volume rules. SHORT slots full, but counter-trend signal weak.\n\nSOL: Currently have SHORT position (unrealized PnL +0.226). 1h BEARISH (price=126.16 < EMA20=128.884, RSI=26.6), 15m BEARISH (price=126.08 < EMA20=126.655, RSI=39.8), 3m BEARISH (price=126.08 < EMA20=126.184, RSI=46.8). All timeframes aligned bearish supporting existing position. Volume ratio 0.26x (WEAK) - below 0.50x but existing position. No reversal signals. Continue holding SHORT.\n\nPOSITION_SLOTS: SHORT_FULL (2/2 used), LONG_AVAILABLE (0/2 used). Constraint: If SHORT full, do NOT force LONG trades unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence. ADA and LINK counter-trend opportunities are not LOW_RISK (weak volume, only 3m alignment). No valid entries.\n\nMARKET_REGIME: Global bearish (6/6 coins bearish). Directional performance: SHORT has 2 consecutive losses, but cooldown not active. Available cash: $66.66.\n\nDecision: Hold existing positions (DOGE SHORT, SOL SHORT).

All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=1.71 (STRONG). Funding negative. Strong trend-following SHORT setup with high volume.\n\nCOUNTER-TRADE ANALYSIS: Empty array - no counter-trade signals.\n\nPOSITION SLOTS: 2 short slots available. Can open up to 2 SHORT positions.\n\nDECISION: Market strongly bearish across all coins. Short performance excellent. Select best 2 SHORT setups (ADA and SOL) based on volume strength and technical alignment. Avoid LINK due to low volume. XRP, DOGE, ASTER also valid but ADA and SOL have strongest volume confirmation.",

Position is profitable (+0.2156). No reversal signals. Hold position.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.11 < EMA20=12.35, RSI=29.5), 15m BEARISH (price=11.95 < EMA20=12.0769, RSI=31.8), 3m BEARISH (price=11.91 < EMA20=12.0095, RSI=34.3). All bearish.

Position slots: 1 SHORT used (ADA), 1 SHORT slot available. LONG slots available=2. Directional performance: SHORT profitable (PI=84%, 11 consecutive wins). No cooldowns. Available cash=$84.27.\n\nDECISION: Multiple strong SHORT setups (XRP, DOGE, ASTER, LINK, SOL). However, SHORT slots available=1 only. Must choose best SHORT opportunity. LINK has strongest volume (1.57 ratio) and all bearish alignments. XRP also strong. LINK selected for highest confidence (0.76). DO NOT force LONG trades since no counter-trend signals and SHORT direction has proven profitability.",

Volume ratio 0.94x is normal. No counter-trade analysis provided, so risk_level unknown. Since 1h and 15m are bearish, this is a potential counter-trend LONG setup, but without risk_level, I cannot assess if it's LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. Given constraints, I will not trade counter-trend without explicit risk assessment. Hold.\n\nDOGE: 1h bearish (price=0.13427 < EMA20=0.1391, RSI 18.1), 15m bearish (price=0.13302 < EMA20=0.1352, RSI 24.5), 3m bullish (price=0.13427 > EMA20=0.1339, RSI 51.2). Similar to XRP, 3m counter-trend bullish, but 1h and 15m bearish. Volume ratio 0.98x normal. No counter-trade analysis.

All timeframes align bearish with strong volume ratio 2.63x. This is a trend-following SHORT setup. Confidence high due to alignment and volume. Target 0.85, stop 0.95. Invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20.\n\nADA: 1h bearish (price=0.3779 < EMA20=0.3908, RSI 25.7), 15m bearish (price=0.3745 < EMA20=0.3792, RSI 34.2), 3m bullish (price=0.3778 > EMA20=0.3765, RSI 52.3). 3m counter-trend bullish, but 1h and 15m bearish. Volume ratio 0.78x normal. Coin is in cooldown (from COOLDOWN_STATUS), so MUST NOT trade.

Volume ratio 1.24x normal. Coin is in cooldown, so MUST NOT trade.

Position slots: long_slots_available=2, short_slots_available=2. Only ASTER shows a clear trend-following SHORT setup with high confidence. Others have mixed signals or are in cooldown. I will execute SHORT on ASTER.",

All three timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.27x (WEAK) - below 0.5x threshold, reducing confidence. Open Interest high but Funding slightly positive. No counter-trade analysis. TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal=INFORMATIONAL (against bearish trend) but strength weak. SHORT trend-following setup exists but volume weak. Confidence moderate.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13427 < EMA20=0.13906, RSI=18.12 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13302 < EMA20=0.13516, RSI=24.5), 3m BEARISH (price=0.13378 < EMA20=0.13391, RSI=46.25).

All bearish. Volume ratio=0.09x (VERY WEAK) - below 0.20x hard rule, DO NOT TRADE. Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL=0.13. TREND_REVERSAL shows no reversal signals. Hold existing position but no new entries due to volume.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3779 < EMA20=0.3908, RSI=25.66), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3745 < EMA20=0.3792, RSI=34.18), 3m BEARISH (price=0.3759 < EMA20=0.3764, RSI=46.46).

Conflict: 1h+15m bearish vs 3m bullish. TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal=MEDIUM strength with current_trend_3m=BULLISH and loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. This suggests potential counter-trend LONG opportunity (3m bullish against 1h bearish). However, volume ratio=0.15x (WEAK) - below 0.20x hard rule, DO NOT TRADE. Also, counter-trade analysis empty, so no explicit risk_level. Given volume weakness and MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK, avoid.\n\nMARKET CONTEXT: Global regime BEARISH (strength=1). Position slots: 1 short used (ASTER), 1 short slot available, 2 long slots available. No cooldowns. Short performance strong (profitability_index=67.8). Volume weakness pervasive across all coins - critical constraint.\n\nDECISION: Volume ratios below 0.20x for ASTER, ADA, LINK, SOL trigger hard 'DO NOT TRADE' rule. XRP and DOGE have volume 0.27x and 0.26x (0.20-0.50x range) - reduce confidence significantly per rules. Given weak volume and bearish alignment, best action is HOLD existing ASTER short and avoid new entries due to low conviction. No counter-trend opportunities meet volume threshold.",

However, COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS is empty, so no quantified edge. Volume ratio=0.24x weak. Without counter-trade analysis showing LOW/MEDIUM risk, cannot execute counter-trend.

Position slots: total_open=1, max_positions=4, short_slots_available=1, long_slots_available=2. Short performance strong (profitability_index=67.8%). No cooldowns active. Volume weakness across all coins (ratios 0.17-0.37x) reduces confidence but >0.20x threshold for most.\n\nDECISION RATIONALE: Prioritize SHORT trend-following setups in strongest bearish alignments. XRP, DOGE, ADA, LINK all show clear bearish alignment across 1h, 15m, 3m. SOL has conflicting signals - avoid. ASTER has existing position and volume too weak for new trades. With only 1 short slot available, choose highest confidence setup: XRP shows strongest bearish momentum with RSI=25.44 on 1h and clear price<EMA across all timeframes.",

Short performance is strong (70.1% profitability index, 13 wins out of 17 trades). No positions currently open, all slots available (4 total, 2 long/2 short). No cooldowns active. Volume is WEAK across all coins (ratios 0.04-0.34x), which significantly reduces confidence per system rules.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=2.0052 < EMA20=2.062, RSI=25.4 oversold). 15m BEARISH (price=2.0052 < EMA20=2.0207, RSI=38.9). 3m BEARISH (price=1.9927 < EMA20=2.0053, RSI=38.6). All timeframes aligned bearish with MACD negative. Volume ratio 0.10x (WEAK) - this violates the hard rule (ratio <=0.20x = DO NOT TRADE). Open Interest high (236M) but funding slightly positive. No clear counter-trend signals. Due to extremely low volume, cannot trade despite bearish alignment.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13366 < EMA20=0.1385, RSI=17.1 severely oversold). 15m BEARISH (price=0.13366 < EMA20=0.1351, RSI=33.3). 3m BEARISH (price=0.13319 < EMA20=0.1337, RSI=40.3). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 0.04x (WEAK) - violates hard rule (<=0.20x). Funding negative. No counter-trend signals. Cannot trade due to volume.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.911 < EMA20=0.9813, RSI=18.7 oversold). 15m BEARISH (price=0.911 < EMA20=0.9375, RSI=23.6). 3m BEARISH (price=0.903 < EMA20=0.9135, RSI=32.4). All bearish. Volume ratio 0.34x (WEAK but above 0.20x threshold). However, volume strength is WEAK and ratio is low (0.34x < 0.50x), which requires significant confidence reduction per rules. No strong counter-trend signals. Risk-reward unclear with such low volume.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3756 < EMA20=0.3892, RSI=24.2 oversold). 15m BEARISH (price=0.3756 < EMA20=0.3790, RSI=38.1). 3m BEARISH (price=0.3727 < EMA20=0.3756, RSI=37.5). All bearish. Volume ratio 0.08x (WEAK) - violates hard rule (<=0.20x). Cannot trade.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=11.97 < EMA20=12.3043, RSI=25.0 oversold). 15m BEARISH (price=11.97 < EMA20=12.0546, RSI=39.9). 3m BEARISH (price=11.9 < EMA20=11.967, RSI=39.7). All bearish. Volume ratio 0.08x (WEAK) - violates hard rule. Cannot trade.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=124.99 < EMA20=128.4226, RSI=23.2 oversold). 15m BEARISH (price=124.99 < EMA20=125.9166, RSI=40.6). 3m BEARISH (price=124.31 < EMA20=124.8094, RSI=41.8). All bearish. Volume ratio 0.10x (WEAK) - violates hard rule. Cannot trade.\n\nSUMMARY: All coins show bearish alignment across timeframes, which would normally support SHORT entries. However, volume is critically low across ALL coins (ratios 0.04-0.34x). Per system rules: 'If volume ratio is <= 0.20x average, DO NOT TRADE. This is a hard rule.' XRP, DOGE, ADA, LINK, SOL all have ratios <=0.20x. ASTER has 0.34x (above threshold but still WEAK). Given the volume weakness and the system's discipline requirement ('Do not force trades. Holding cash is a valid and often superior position when no clear edge exists.'), the correct action is to HOLD all coins. No counter-trade analysis provided, so no counter-trend opportunities to consider.",

All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 0.47x (WEAK) but above 0.20x threshold. Funding slightly negative. Strong trend-following SHORT setup. Confidence 0.68.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=124.99 < EMA20=128.4226, RSI=23.22 oversold). 15m BEARISH (price=124.35 < EMA20=125.8557, RSI=37.16). 3m BEARISH (price=124.35 < EMA20=124.7648, RSI=42.46). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 0.22x (WEAK) but above 0.20x threshold. Funding slightly positive. Strong trend-following SHORT setup. Recent short performance strong. Confidence 0.73.\n\nCOUNTER-TRADE ANALYSIS: Empty array - no counter-trade signals.\n\nPOSITION SLOTS: 2 short slots available. Can open up to 2 short positions. No long positions needed as all coins show bearish alignment.\n\nSELECTION: Choose strongest SHORT setups with highest confidence and volume support. XRP (0.75), ASTER (0.72), SOL (0.73), ADA (0.70), LINK (0.68). DOGE excluded due to volume violation. Select XRP and SOL as top two with highest confidence and reasonable volume. ASTER also strong but slightly lower confidence than SOL.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT: Use 10x leverage as fixed. Set stop-loss at 1h ATR or swing high. Take-profit at 1:1.3 risk-reward ratio. Hard margin stop at 3-7% loss will trigger automatically.\n\nINVALIDATION: Close if 1h price closes above 1h EMA20 (trend reversal).",
