    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish (6/6 coins bearish), with short slots full (2/2 used) and long slots available (2/2). Counter-trade analysis is empty, so no counter-trend opportunities. Trend reversal data shows mostly INFORMATIONAL 3m reversals, which are weak and should not trigger exits per rules. Volume is weak for most coins (ratio <0.5x), reducing confidence. Position slots constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE, so only LONG entries are allowed if high confidence, but no strong bullish setups exist. Holding cash is valid when no clear edge exists.\n\nXRP: 1h bearish (price=2.0785 < EMA20=2.1619, RSI=25.3 oversold), 15m bearish (price=2.0806 < EMA20=2.1196, RSI=26.9 oversold), 3m bearish (price=2.0795 < EMA20=2.0819, RSI=45.0). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.89x (normal). Existing short position with unrealized PnL=-0.0246. Reversal signal: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL (weak), loss risk LOW. No bullish alignment; hold short.\n\nDOGE: 1h bearish (price=0.1392 < EMA20=0.1465, RSI=19.1 oversold), 15m bearish (price=0.13908 < EMA20=0.1430, RSI=19.2 oversold), 3m bearish (price=0.13907 < EMA20=0.1395, RSI=38.0). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.25x (weak, caution). Existing short position with unrealized PnL=+0.0454. Reversal signal: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL (weak), loss risk LOW. No bullish alignment; hold short.\n\nASTER: 1h bearish (price=0.994 < EMA20=1.0488, RSI=24.4 oversold), 15m bearish (price=0.989 < EMA20=1.0275, RSI=14.3 oversold), 3m bearish (price=0.992 < EMA20=0.9962, RSI=42.8). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.26x (weak, do not trade). Reversal signal: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL (weak), loss risk LOW. No bullish setup; hold.\n\nADA: 1h bearish (price=0.3901 < EMA20=0.4132, RSI=21.9 oversold), 15m bearish (price=0.3912 < EMA20=0.4032, RSI=23.6 oversold), 3m bearish (price=0.3907 < EMA20=0.3917, RSI=41.8). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.17x (weak, do not trade). Reversal signal: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL (weak), loss risk LOW. No bullish setup; hold.\n\nLINK: 1h bearish (price=12.28 < EMA20=12.9526, RSI=21.7 oversold), 15m bearish (price=12.36 < EMA20=12.6761, RSI=24.2 oversold), 3m mixed (price=12.35 ≈ EMA20=12.3476, RSI=47.0 neutral). 1h and 15m bearish, 3m neutral. Volume ratio=0.50x (normal). Reversal signal: 3m reversal MEDIUM strength, loss risk MEDIUM. No strong bullish alignment; 3m reversal is against bearish trend but not sufficient for long entry without higher confidence. Hold.\n\nSOL: 1h bearish (price=127.98 < EMA20=134.7382, RSI=22.9 oversold), 15m bearish (price=128.34 < EMA20=131.558, RSI=21.2 oversold), 3m bearish (price=128.03 < EMA20=128.3674, RSI=40.5). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.47x (weak, caution). Reversal signal: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL (weak), loss risk LOW. No bullish setup; hold.\n\nSummary: All coins in bearish regimes with oversold RSI, but no strong bullish reversals or counter-trend signals. Volume weak for most, reducing confidence. Short slots full, so no new shorts; long entries require strong bullish alignment, which is absent. Hold all positions and cash.",

Global regime is bearish with all coins in bearish market regimes. Position slots: 2 short positions open (XRP and ADA), short_slots_available=0, long_slots_available=2. Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE, so no new SHORT entries allowed. Counter-trade analysis is empty, no explicit counter-trend opportunities. Trend reversal data shows no strong reversal signals against existing positions; mostly informational or medium strength, not warranting exits. Volume ratios are weak across all coins (<0.5x), reducing confidence in new entries. No cooldowns active. Analysis per coin: XRP: 1h bearish (price=2.0574 < EMA20=2.1599, RSI=22.9), 15m bearish (price=2.0575 < EMA20=2.1087, RSI=22.2), 3m bearish (price=2.0653 < EMA20=2.0709, RSI=40.9).

Mixed signals; 3m bullish but 1h and 15m bearish, potential counter-trend LONG. Risk level from reversal data: MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK, but no counter-trade analysis provided, so confidence insufficient (<0.65). Volume ratio 0.145 (weak), hold.

All coins show bearish trends, but cannot add new SHORT positions. Existing SHORT positions (XRP, ADA) are profitable and aligned with trends; hold them.
