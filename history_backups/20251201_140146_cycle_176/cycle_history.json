Evaluate counter-trend: 3m bullish aligns with 15m? No, 15m bearish. Risk likely MEDIUM_RISK or HIGH_RISK due to 1h bearish conflict. Without COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS, cannot confirm risk_level. Conservative approach: do not trade counter-trend without explicit LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK signal. HOLD.\n\nOverall: Global regime bearish, 2 SHORT positions open (ADA, ASTER).

This is a counter-trend LONG opportunity. Risk_level from COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS is not provided, but based on reversal signals (3m reversal true, strength MEDIUM) and alignment (3m bullish vs. 1h bearish), this is likely MEDIUM_RISK.

Invalidation: if 1h price closes above EMA20 (12.4828).\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=127.38 < EMA20=130.1715, RSI=30.29), 15m BEARISH (price=127.15 < EMA20=127.2312, RSI=44.85), 3m BULLISH (price=127.15 > EMA20=127.1319, RSI=50.34). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.19 (WEAK, below 0.20 threshold - HARD RULE: DO NOT TRADE). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM, current_trend_3m=BULLISH. Counter-trend LONG opportunity, but volume ratio=0.19 <= 0.20, so DO NOT TRADE per volume_rules weakness_warning. Skip.\n\nOverall: Market regime is bearish globally. POSITION_SLOTS: total_open=2, max_positions=4, short_slots_used=2 (full), long_slots_available=2. Constraint: short slots full, so cannot open SHORT entries. For LONG entries, only consider counter-trend opportunities with valid risk levels. From analysis, XRP, DOGE, LINK have counter-trend LONG setups, but all have weak volume, reducing confidence. SOL has volume below 0.20, so skip. ASTER and ADA have existing SHORT positions aligned with bearish trends; hold. No cooldowns active. Decision: Given weak volume and medium confidence, prioritize holding existing positions and avoid new entries unless high confidence. For counter-trend LONGs, confidence is low (0.4-0.5), below min_confidence threshold of 0.4 for some, but volume weakness further reduces. Best to HOLD across all coins except possibly one with highest confidence. XRP has volume ratio=0.45 and medium risk, confidence around 0.45, but still low. Adhere to discipline: do not force trades. Hold cash when no clear edge exists.",

Timeframes conflict: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume ratio=1.19 normal. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM, current_trend_3m=BULLISH, loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. This is a counter-trend LONG opportunity (3m bullish vs. 1h bearish). Risk_level from COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS is not provided, but based on reversal signals, it's MEDIUM_RISK. Confidence moderate due to 3m alignment and volume. However, POSITION_SLOTS shows short_slots_available=0, long_slots_available=2. Constraint_instruction: If a direction is FULL (SHORT full), do NOT force trades in the other direction unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. This is MEDIUM_RISK, so LONG entry is allowed.

Similar to XRP: counter-trend LONG. Volume ratio=0.64 normal. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM, loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Risk_level MEDIUM_RISK. SHORT slots full, but MEDIUM_RISK allows LONG entry. Confidence moderate. Invalidation: if 1h price closes above EMA20 (0.14101).\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.987 < EMA20=1.019, RSI=29.29 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.985 < EMA20=0.9963, RSI=33.59), 3m BEARISH (price=0.987 < EMA20=0.9898, RSI=41.95). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.48 weak (0.20-0.50x), reduce confidence. Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL=-0.63. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows no reversal signals. Continue holding SHORT as trend-following setup remains valid. Exit plan: profit_target=0.97, stop_loss=1.02, invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20 (1.019).\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3832 < EMA20=0.39674, RSI=25.73 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3833 < EMA20=0.38564, RSI=36.36), 3m BEARISH (price=0.3832 < EMA20=0.38421, RSI=33.26). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.97 normal. Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL=+0.35. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows no reversal signals. Continue holding SHORT. Exit plan: profit_target=0.378, stop_loss=0.392, invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20 (0.39674).\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.15 < EMA20=12.478, RSI=27.56 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.1698, RSI=40.78), 3m BEARISH (price=12.15 < EMA20=12.1556, RSI=46.81). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.32 weak (0.20-0.50x), reduce confidence significantly. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows no reversal signals. Trend-following SHORT setup, but volume weak and SHORT slots full (short_slots_available=0). Constraint_instruction: do NOT force trades in the other direction unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. This is not a counter-trend opportunity, so HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=127.19 < EMA20=130.153, RSI=29.26 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=127.15 < EMA20=127.231, RSI=44.85), 3m BULLISH (price=127.19 > EMA20=127.142, RSI=52.32).

SHORT slots full, but MEDIUM_RISK allows LONG entry. Confidence moderate. Invalidation: if 1h price closes above EMA20 (130.153).\n\nOverall: Global regime bearish, 2 existing SHORT positions (ADA, ASTER). SHORT slots full, but counter-trend LONG opportunities (XRP, DOGE, SOL) are MEDIUM_RISK and allowed per constraints. Choose best edge: XRP has highest volume ratio (1.19) and 3m RSI=54.49, offering strongest counter-trend signal. DOGE and SOL similar but slightly weaker. Execute one LONG to diversify and avoid overexposure. Use available slots (2 long_slots_available). Set TP/SL based on ATR: for XRP, 1h ATR=0.0207, target ~2% move (TP=2.084, SL=2.004). Ensure risk-reward at least 1:1.3.\n\nCheck COOLDOWN_STATUS: no cooldowns active. POSITION_SLOTS: total_open=2, max_positions=4, available_slots=2. Can open up to 2 new positions.\n\nDecision: Open LONG on XRP as highest-confidence counter-trend setup. Hold existing SHORTs. HOLD others.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing.\n\nXRP: Currently in a SHORT position with unrealized PnL -0.21074394. 1h BEARISH (price=2.0357 < EMA20=2.0858, RSI=27.68), 15m BEARISH (price=2.0354 < EMA20=2.0437, RSI=39.55), 3m BEARISH (price=2.0354 < EMA20=2.0400, RSI=40.18). All timeframes aligned bearish, but volume ratio=0.29x is weak (<0.50x), reducing confidence. No reversal signals per TREND_REVERSAL_DATA. Position slots: short_slots_used=1, short_slots_available=1. Continue holding as trend remains bearish, but monitor for invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20 (2.092).\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.137 < EMA20=0.1406, RSI=23.54), 15m BEARISH (price=0.137 < EMA20=0.1373, RSI=40.40), 3m BULLISH (price=0.137 > EMA20=0.1370, RSI=50.87). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, but 3m bullish with volume ratio=1.28x normal. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m_reversal=true with strength=MEDIUM and loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK, indicating potential counter-trend LONG opportunity. However, risk_level from counter_trade_analysis is not provided (empty array), so cannot assess confidence. Given constraints, avoid due to unclear edge and medium loss risk. Hold.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.974 < EMA20=1.0145, RSI=25.83), 15m BEARISH (price=0.974 < EMA20=0.9942, RSI=26.60), 3m BEARISH (price=0.974 < EMA20=0.9876, RSI=27.04). All timeframes aligned bearish with strong volume ratio=8.86x. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m_reversal=true with strength=INFORMATIONAL and loss_risk_signal=LOW_LOSS_RISK, but this is informational only per reversal_strength_definitions. No clear counter-trend signal. Trend-following SHORT is valid, but volume is high, suggesting strong bearish momentum. However, short_slots_available=1, and same_direction_limit allows up to 2 shorts. Consider SHORT entry with confidence reduced due to overextended bearish move (RSI low).\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.383 < EMA20=0.3954, RSI=26.01), 15m BEARISH (price=0.383 < EMA20=0.3853, RSI=35.66), 3m BEARISH (price=0.3829 < EMA20=0.3838, RSI=35.30). All timeframes aligned bearish with strong volume ratio=1.97x. No reversal signals. Trend-following SHORT setup is strong, but short_slots_available=1. Must prioritize between ASTER and ADA based on edge.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.4414, RSI=27.98), 15m BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.1643, RSI=41.86), 3m BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.1465, RSI=43.47). All timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume ratio=1.33x. No reversal signals. Trend-following SHORT valid, but short_slots_available=1. Compare with others.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=127.17 < EMA20=129.8633, RSI=29.42), 15m BEARISH (price=127.16 < EMA20=127.2218, RSI=45.10), 3m BULLISH (price=127.17 > EMA20=127.1403, RSI=51.43). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish with volume ratio=0.61x normal. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m_reversal=true with strength=MEDIUM and loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK, similar to DOGE. Risk unclear; hold.\n\nDecision Rationale: Global regime is bearish with all coins in BEARISH market_regime. Short performance has been profitable (net_pnl=2.091, profitability_index=100). Position slots: long_slots_available=2, short_slots_available=1, total open positions=1 (XRP short). Constraint: short_slots_available=1, so can open one new SHORT. Choose the strongest bearish setup: ASTER has strongest volume and alignment, but RSI very low (oversold). ADA has strong volume and alignment with slightly higher RSI, offering better risk-reward. LINK is also valid. Select ADA as it shows consistent bearish momentum across timeframes with good volume. For XRP, hold existing short but monitor for invalidation. Others: hold due to mixed signals or lack of edge.\n[Auto Exit Note: TP/SL or extended-loss closure executed before this analysis]",

All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio 0.36x (WEAK) but not below 0.20x threshold. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows no reversal signals against short position. Position performing well, continue holding with existing exit plan.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.137 < EMA20=0.1406, RSI 23.5), 15m BEARISH (price=0.1366 < EMA20=0.1372, RSI 36.2), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.13675 ≈ EMA20=0.13678, RSI 46.4). Strong bearish alignment on 1h and 15m. Volume ratio 5.97x (STRONG) indicates conviction. No reversal signals. SHORT slots available (1). High confidence SHORT setup.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.974 < EMA20=1.0145, RSI 25.8), 15m BEARISH (price=0.96 < EMA20=0.9905, RSI 20.8), 3m BEARISH (price=0.962 < EMA20=0.9764, RSI 25.8). All timeframes bearish. Volume ratio 0.10x (WEAK) - CRITICAL: Below 0.20x threshold. DO NOT TRADE per hard rule. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal signal but strength INFORMATIONAL only.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.383 < EMA20=0.3954, RSI 26.0), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3803 < EMA20=0.3846, RSI 28.5), 3m BEARISH (price=0.381 < EMA20=0.3822, RSI 32.3). All timeframes bearish. Volume ratio 0.29x (WEAK) but above 0.20x threshold. No reversal signals. SHORT slots available (1). Valid SHORT setup.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.4414, RSI 28.0), 15m BEARISH (price=12.12 < EMA20=12.1575, RSI 41.0), 3m NEUTRAL (price=12.13 ≈ EMA20=12.1284, RSI 48.1). Bearish alignment on 1h and 15m. Volume ratio 0.22x (WEAK) but above 0.20x threshold. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal signal with MEDIUM strength and MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. This suggests caution for new SHORT entries. Given risk_level MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK and reversal signal, avoid trading LINK.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=127.17 < EMA20=129.8633, RSI 29.4), 15m BEARISH (price=126.68 < EMA20=127.1289, RSI 38.1), 3m BEARISH (price=126.74 < EMA20=126.9157, RSI 39.1). All timeframes bearish. Volume ratio 0.28x (WEAK) but above 0.20x threshold. No reversal signals. SHORT slots available (1). Valid SHORT setup.\n\nPOSITION_SLOTS: 1 short position (XRP), 1 short slot available. Cannot open LONGs (0 long slots available). Market regime BEARISH globally. Short performance strong (4 wins, 0 losses). No cooldowns active.\n\nDecision: Hold existing XRP short. Open SHORT positions on DOGE, ADA, and SOL (all bearish alignments with volume above threshold). Skip ASTER (volume too low) and LINK (reversal risk).",

Global regime is bearish with all coins in BEARISH market regime. Position slots: short slots full (2 used, 0 available), long slots available (2). Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE, so do NOT force LONG trades unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence. Counter-trade analysis is empty, no counter-trend opportunities identified. Trend reversal data shows no strong reversals; only INFORMATIONAL 3m reversals for ASTER, ADA, LINK, but these are weak and not actionable for exits. Volume analysis: XRP and ADA have weak volume (ratio <=0.50x), so avoid trades. Other coins have normal volume. Cooldown status: no cooldowns active. Historical context: recent shorts with high confidence, performance trend consolidation. Risk: available cash $67.76, max positions 4, current 2 positions (DOGE short, ADA short).\n\nXRP: 1h bearish (price=2.0357 < EMA20=2.0858, RSI 27.68 oversold), 15m bearish (price=2.0259 < EMA20=2.0417, RSI 33.53), 3m bearish (price=2.0259 < EMA20=2.0332, RSI 32.23).

All timeframes aligned bearish, volume normal. Reversal signals: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL, but strength INFORMATIONAL is weak; do not exit if had position. No position, short slots full, cannot open SHORT. LONG not justified due to bearish alignment and no counter-trend signal.\nADA: Has short position. 1h bearish (price=0.383 < EMA20=0.3954, RSI 26.01 oversold), 15m bearish (price=0.3797 < EMA20=0.3846, RSI 27.26), 3m bearish (price=0.3797 < EMA20=0.3818, RSI 24.71). All timeframes aligned bearish, but volume ratio 0.182 (WEAK) below 0.20x, so avoid new trades per hard rule. Reversal signals: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL, but strength INFORMATIONAL is weak; do not exit. Position is profitable (unrealized PnL 0.209). Hold position; no exit signal.\nLINK: 1h bearish (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.4414, RSI 27.98 oversold), 15m bearish (price=12.1 < EMA20=12.1556, RSI 37.73), 3m bearish (price=12.1 < EMA20=12.1241, RSI 38.25). All timeframes aligned bearish, volume normal. Reversal signals: 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL, but not actionable. No position, short slots full, cannot open SHORT. LONG not justified due to bearish alignment and no counter-trend signal.\nSOL: 1h bearish (price=127.17 < EMA20=129.8633, RSI 29.42 oversold), 15m bearish (price=126.51 < EMA20=127.1127, RSI 35.98), 3m bearish (price=126.51 < EMA20=126.8476, RSI 30.78).

Short performance is excellent (11 wins, 0 losses, profitability_index=100). No cooldowns active. Position slots: 4 available (2 long, 2 short).\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=2.0357 < EMA20=2.0858, RSI=27.68). 15m BEARISH (price=2.0191 < EMA20=2.0377, RSI=30.13). 3m BEARISH (price=2.0049 < EMA20=2.0256, RSI=17.69). All timeframes aligned BEARISH with STRONG volume (ratio=4.03). MACD negative across all timeframes. Strong trend-following SHORT setup. Open Interest high (236M). Funding slightly negative (-0.000061).\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.137 < EMA20=0.1406, RSI=23.54). 15m BEARISH (price=0.13578 < EMA20=0.1369, RSI=29.14). 3m BEARISH (price=0.13454 < EMA20=0.1362, RSI=11.4). All timeframes aligned BEARISH with STRONG volume (ratio=9.37). MACD negative across all timeframes. Strong trend-following SHORT setup. Open Interest very high (1.39B). Funding negative (-0.000143).\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.974 < EMA20=1.0145, RSI=25.83). 15m BEARISH (price=0.928 < EMA20=0.9793, RSI=13.42). 3m BEARISH (price=0.921 < EMA20=0.9545, RSI=14.05). All timeframes aligned BEARISH but volume is WEAK (ratio=0.41). MACD negative across all timeframes. Low volume violates hard rule (ratio <= 0.50x). DO NOT TRADE due to weak volume.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.383 < EMA20=0.3954, RSI=26.01). 15m BEARISH (price=0.3773 < EMA20=0.3833, RSI=23.43). 3m BEARISH (price=0.3744 < EMA20=0.3795, RSI=10.93). All timeframes aligned BEARISH with STRONG volume (ratio=4.44). MACD negative across all timeframes. Strong trend-following SHORT setup. Open Interest moderate (279M). Funding negative (-0.000108).\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.13 < EMA20=12.4414, RSI=27.98). 15m BEARISH (price=12.05 < EMA20=12.1356, RSI=32.82). 3m BEARISH (price=11.95 < EMA20=12.0794, RSI=18.9). All timeframes aligned BEARISH with STRONG volume (ratio=7.04). MACD negative across all timeframes. Strong trend-following SHORT setup. Open Interest low (7.38M). Funding slightly negative (-0.000064).\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=127.17 < EMA20=129.8633, RSI=29.42). 15m BEARISH (price=126.18 < EMA20=126.9415, RSI=32.85). 3m BEARISH (price=125.66 < EMA20=126.463, RSI=17.02). All timeframes aligned BEARISH with STRONG volume (ratio=2.86). MACD negative across all timeframes. Strong trend-following SHORT setup. Open Interest moderate (7.51M). Funding negative (-0.000095).\n\nCOUNTER-TRADE ANALYSIS: Empty array. No counter-trend signals.\n\nPOSITION SLOTS: 2 short slots available. Can open up to 2 SHORT positions.\n\nDECISION: Market is strongly bearish. Multiple coins show aligned bearish signals across all timeframes with strong volume. Select the 2 strongest SHORT setups (XRP and DOGE) based on volume strength, Open Interest, and technical alignment. ASTER excluded due to weak volume. ADA, LINK, SOL are also valid but XRP and DOGE have highest volume ratios and clear bearish momentum.\n[Auto Exit Note: TP/SL or extended-loss closure executed before this analysis]",

Short performance has been strong (net PnL +6.13, 13 wins out of 14 trades). No directional cooldowns. XRP and DOGE are in coin cooldown (1 cycle) - cannot trade them. Position slots: 4 available (2 long, 2 short).\n\nXRP: In cooldown - SKIP. Analysis: 1h bearish (price=2.0296 < EMA20=2.0852, RSI=26.2), 15m bearish (price=2.0191 < EMA20=2.0377, RSI=30.1), 3m mixed (price=2.0296 > EMA20=2.0269, RSI=50.8). Volume strong (ratio=1.91). 3m shows potential bullish reversal but coin is in cooldown.\n\nDOGE: In cooldown - SKIP. Analysis: 1h bearish (price=0.1362 < EMA20=0.1406, RSI=21.8), 15m bearish (price=0.1358 < EMA20=0.1369, RSI=29.1), 3m mixed (price=0.1362 ≈ EMA20=0.1363, RSI=46.7). Volume strong (ratio=2.23). Similar to XRP, 3m shows potential reversal but coin is in cooldown.\n\nASTER: 1h strongly bearish (price=0.935 < EMA20=1.0108, RSI=19.0), 15m strongly bearish (price=0.928 < EMA20=0.9793, RSI=13.4), 3m bearish (price=0.935 < EMA20=0.9530, RSI=30.6). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume normal (ratio=1.28). Open Interest 144.9M, funding slightly negative. Strong trend-following SHORT setup with high confidence.\n\nADA: 1h bearish (price=0.3791 < EMA20=0.3950, RSI=23.1), 15m bearish (price=0.3773 < EMA20=0.3833, RSI=23.4), 3m mixed (price=0.3792 ≈ EMA20=0.3797, RSI=42.4). Volume normal (ratio=1.29). 3m shows potential bullish reversal but 1h and 15m remain bearish. Could be counter-trend LONG opportunity but risk level would be HIGH_RISK due to 1h+15m bearish alignment. Better to HOLD.\n\nLINK: 1h bearish (price=12.12 < EMA20=12.4405, RSI=27.3), 15m bearish (price=12.05 < EMA20=12.1356, RSI=32.8), 3m bullish (price=12.12 > EMA20=12.0885, RSI=54.0). Volume normal (ratio=1.37). 3m shows strong bullish momentum but conflicts with higher timeframes. Counter-trend LONG possible but risk level MEDIUM_RISK (3m alignment + strong RSI). However, confidence threshold for counter-trend is 0.65+ and this doesn't meet it given 1h+15m bearish strength.\n\nSOL: 1h bearish (price=126.85 < EMA20=129.8328, RSI=28.3), 15m bearish (price=126.18 < EMA20=126.9415, RSI=32.9), 3m bullish (price=126.87 > EMA20=126.5552, RSI=56.1). Volume strong (ratio=1.81). Similar to LINK - 3m bullish but higher timeframes bearish. Counter-trend LONG possible with MEDIUM_RISK. However, 3m RSI=56.1 shows momentum but not oversold, reducing edge. Confidence would be around 0.6, below 0.65 threshold.\n\nDECISION: Only ASTER presents a clear, high-confidence trend-following SHORT opportunity with all timeframes aligned bearish. Other coins either in cooldown or have mixed signals that don't meet confidence thresholds. Short slots available (2), so can execute. Use tight stops due to system's hard margin stop loss at 3-7% loss.",

No trade.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.85 < EMA20=129.8328, RSI=28.3), 15m BEARISH (price=126.18 < EMA20=126.9415, RSI=32.9), 3m BULLISH (price=126.74 > EMA20=126.5692, RSI=52.5). 3m reversal signal with MEDIUM strength. Volume ratio=0.24x (WEAK) - hard rule violation. No trade.\n\nGLOBAL CONTEXT: Market regime BEARISH (6/6 coins bearish). Short performance strong (PI=66.4). Position slots: 1 SHORT used (ASTER), 1 SHORT slot available, 2 LONG slots available. No cooldowns active. All coins show weak volume (<0.50x average), triggering hard rule against trading. No counter-trade analysis provided. Weakest position is ASTER with -0.58 PnL but still within stop loss.\n\nCONCLUSION: Volume weakness across all coins prohibits new entries per hard rule. Only existing ASTER SHORT position continues as 1h trend remains bearish and no reversal signals. All other coins HOLD.",

Volume ratio=0.091 (WEAK, <0.20x, hard rule: DO NOT TRADE new entries). For existing short position, reversal signal is MEDIUM (3m reversal only), so monitor but no immediate exit. Position slots: short slots available=1, but volume weakness prohibits new trades. Invalidation condition: 1h price closes above EMA20 (2.079).\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13617 < EMA20=0.1401, RSI=22.0), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13617 < EMA20=0.1369, RSI=35.7), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.13626 ≈ EMA20=0.1362, RSI=49.0). 1h and 15m aligned bearish, but 3m reversal signal (strength=MEDIUM). Volume ratio=0.051 (WEAK, <0.20x, hard rule: DO NOT TRADE). No position, but low volume prevents entry. Short slots available=1, but cannot trade due to volume.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.942 < EMA20=1.005, RSI=21.3), 15m BEARISH (price=0.942 < EMA20=0.977, RSI=23.8), 3m BEARISH (price=0.939 < EMA20=0.947, RSI=37.4). All timeframes aligned bearish with no reversal signals (strength=INFORMATIONAL). Volume ratio=0.332 (WEAK, but >0.20x, caution). Short slots available=1, but confidence reduced due to low volume. Consider SHORT if volume improves, but current setup is weak.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3793 < EMA20=0.394, RSI=23.2), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3793 < EMA20=0.383, RSI=32.6), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.3799 ≈ EMA20=0.3797, RSI=48.2). Existing LONG position. Reversal signals: htf_reversal=true (1h reversal against long), 3m_reversal=true (strength=MEDIUM). Volume ratio=0.080 (WEAK, <0.20x). Position slots: long slots available=0 (full). Invalidation condition: 3m price closes below EMA20 (0.3797). Current price=0.3799 > EMA20=0.3797, so hold but monitor closely.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.14 < EMA20=12.412, RSI=28.8), 15m NEUTRAL (price=12.14 ≈ EMA20=12.142, RSI=46.7), 3m BULLISH (price=12.15 > EMA20=12.113, RSI=56.3). Mixed signals: 1h bearish, 3m bullish. Volume ratio=0.264 (WEAK, but >0.20x). Short slots available=1, but 3m bullish suggests counter-trend LONG opportunity. However, risk_level not provided in COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS (empty), so cannot assess. Without counter-trade data, default to trend-following: 1h bearish dominant, but 3m alignment weak. Low confidence.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.77 < EMA20=129.52, RSI=28.9), 15m BEARISH (price=126.77 < EMA20=126.96, RSI=43.9), 3m BULLISH (price=127.54 > EMA20=126.81, RSI=66.9).

Long slots full, short slots available=1. Volume weakness across all coins prohibits new trades per hard rule (volume ratio <=0.20x). For existing positions, reversal signals are MEDIUM (3m only), so continue holding unless invalidation conditions hit. No high-confidence setups due to volume and slot constraints.",

All three timeframes aligned bearish with volume ratio 0.50x (NORMAL). Open Interest high, funding negative. Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL +0.44. Reversal signals show only 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL) against position, but 15m and htf remain bearish. Continue holding SHORT. Invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20 (2.079).\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.13617 < EMA20=0.1401, RSI=22.0), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13597 < EMA20=0.1368, RSI=33.6), 3m BEARISH (price=0.13597 < EMA20=0.1362, RSI=44.8). All three timeframes aligned bearish but volume ratio 0.45x (WEAK). Open Interest high, funding negative. No position. Reversal signals show only 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL). SHORT slots available=1, but volume weakness reduces confidence. Wait for stronger volume confirmation.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.942 < EMA20=1.005, RSI=21.3), 15m BEARISH (price=0.933 < EMA20=0.972, RSI=20.3), 3m BEARISH (price=0.933 < EMA20=0.944, RSI=33.9). All three timeframes aligned bearish but volume ratio 0.40x (WEAK). Open Interest moderate, funding slightly negative. No position. Reversal signals show only 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL). SHORT slots available=1, but volume weakness reduces confidence. Wait for stronger setup.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3793 < EMA20=0.394, RSI=23.2), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3792 < EMA20=0.383, RSI=33.2), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.3792 ≈ EMA20=0.3795, RSI=45.9). Timeframes mixed: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m neutral. Volume ratio 0.52x (NORMAL). Existing LONG position with unrealized PnL +0.04. Reversal signals show htf_reversal=true and 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL) against position. This is concerning for LONG thesis. Invalidation condition: if 3m price closes below 3m EMA20 (0.3797). Current price 0.3792 is below EMA20 0.3795, nearing invalidation. Consider closing position due to reversal signals and mixed alignment.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.14 < EMA20=12.412, RSI=28.8), 15m BEARISH (price=12.11 < EMA20=12.136, RSI=42.9), 3m NEUTRAL (price=12.11 ≈ EMA20=12.108, RSI=49.9). Timeframes mixed: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m neutral. Volume ratio 0.19x (WEAK - below 0.20x hard rule). Open Interest low, funding negative. No position. Reversal signals show 3m reversal (MEDIUM) but current_trend_3m is BULLISH, indicating potential counter-trend LONG opportunity. However, volume ratio <= 0.20x, DO NOT TRADE per hard rule. Skip.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.77 < EMA20=129.52, RSI=28.9), 15m BEARISH (price=127.5 > EMA20=127.09, RSI=53.3), 3m BULLISH (price=127.5 > EMA20=126.94, RSI=63.6). Timeframes mixed: 1h bearish, 15m neutral-bullish, 3m bullish. Volume ratio 0.76x (NORMAL). Existing LONG position with unrealized PnL +0.34. Reversal signals show htf_reversal=true and 3m reversal (MEDIUM) against position. This suggests weakening LONG thesis. Invalidation condition: if 3m price closes below 3m EMA20 (126.67). Current price 127.5 is above, but reversal signals warrant caution. Continue monitoring.\n\nGlobal regime BEARISH with 6 bearish coins. Position slots: LONG slots used=2 (FULL), SHORT slots available=1. Constraint: LONG_FULL_SHORT_AVAILABLE - do NOT force trades in SHORT direction unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. Counter-trade analysis empty. Cooldowns inactive. Risk: total positions=3, max=4, available cash $54.25.\n\nDecision rationale: Close ADA LONG due to reversal signals and mixed alignment. Hold XRP SHORT and SOL LONG with monitoring. No new entries due to volume weakness (DOGE, ASTER, LINK) or slot constraints (LONG full).",

SHORT slots available=1, propose SHORT with low confidence.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3793 < EMA20=0.394, RSI=23.2 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3792 < EMA20=0.383, RSI=33.2), 3m BEARISH (price=0.3787 < EMA20=0.379, RSI=43.7). All timeframes aligned bearish, but volume ratio=0.17x (WEAK) violates rule (<=0.20x do not trade). Do NOT trade due to low volume.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.14 < EMA20=12.412, RSI=28.8), 15m BEARISH (price=12.11 < EMA20=12.136, RSI=42.9), 3m NEUTRAL (price=12.1 ≈ EMA20=12.109, RSI=47.8). 3m not strongly bearish, reducing alignment. Volume ratio=0.14x (WEAK) violates rule (<=0.20x do not trade). Do NOT trade due to low volume and weak 3m signal.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.77 < EMA20=129.52, RSI=28.9), 15m BULLISH (price=127.5 > EMA20=127.09, RSI=53.3), 3m BULLISH (price=127.03 > EMA20=127.00, RSI=51.6). Mixed signals: 1h bearish, 15m/3m bullish. TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows htf_reversal=true (1h reversal against long position) and 3m reversal=true with strength=MEDIUM, indicating reversal against long position. Existing LONG position with unrealized PnL=0.0148 positive. Reversal signals suggest closing LONG, but PnL positive and 15m/3m still bullish. Invalidation condition: if 3m price closes below EMA20 (126.67). Current price=127.03 > 126.67, so not invalidated. However, reversal strength MEDIUM and htf_reversal true increase risk. Consider closing LONG to avoid potential loss, but since PnL positive and not invalidated, hold with caution. LONG slots available=1, but no new entry due to mixed signals.\n\nGlobal regime BEARISH, short performance better (profitability index 59.4 vs long 100 but only 2 trades). Position slots: long_slots_used=1, short_slots_used=1, available_slots=2. No cooldowns active. Volume weakness across most coins limits confidence. Prioritize holding existing positions and only enter new SHORTS if volume acceptable and alignment strong.",

All three timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.43x (WEAK) but above 0.20x threshold. Existing SHORT position with +0.606 PnL. TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal=INFORMATIONAL (only 3m shows reversal against short position). Continue holding as 1h trend remains bearish and reversal is weak.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.136 < EMA20=0.140, RSI=22.0 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.136 < EMA20=0.137, RSI=31.5), 3m BEARISH (price=0.136 < EMA20=0.136, RSI=40.4). All three timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.19x (WEAK) - BELOW 0.20x threshold! This violates volume rule. Existing SHORT position with +0.047 PnL. TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal=INFORMATIONAL. Given volume weakness, consider closing but PnL positive. However, volume rule is hard: DO NOT TRADE if volume ratio <= 0.20x. Since position exists, close to avoid risk.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.942 < EMA20=1.005, RSI=21.3 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.932 < EMA20=0.972, RSI=19.3 oversold), 3m BEARISH (price=0.932 < EMA20=0.940, RSI=35.6). All three timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.21x (WEAK) but above 0.20x threshold. No position. SHORT slots are FULL (short_slots_available=0). Cannot open new SHORT. No counter-trade signal. HOLD.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.379 < EMA20=0.394, RSI=23.2 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.379 < EMA20=0.383, RSI=34.0), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.379 ≈ EMA20=0.379, RSI=47.4). 1h+15m bearish, 3m neutral. Volume ratio=0.37x (WEAK) but above threshold. No position. SHORT slots are FULL. Cannot open new SHORT. No counter-trade signal.

TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal=MEDIUM with current_trend_3m=BULLISH. Volume ratio=0.69x (NORMAL). Counter-trade analysis empty, but 3m alignment suggests possible LONG. However, SHORT slots are FULL, LONG slots available=1. Counter-trend direction is 15m+3m direction = BULLISH (3m bullish, 15m bearish - mixed). Risk level not specified, but 3m bullish with normal volume. Could be MEDIUM_RISK. But constraint: If SHORT_FULL, do NOT force trades in other direction unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. This is borderline, but confidence not high enough (RSI=51.7 neutral). Better to HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.77 < EMA20=129.52, RSI=28.9), 15m NEUTRAL (price=127.19 ≈ EMA20=127.06, RSI=49.6), 3m BULLISH (price=127.19 > EMA20=127.04, RSI=55.3, MACD positive). 1h bearish, 15m neutral, 3m bullish - mixed. Existing LONG position with +0.107 PnL. TREND_REVERSAL shows htf_reversal=true (1h reversal against long), 3m reversal=MEDIUM. This is STRONG reversal signal (15m+3m both show reversal against long? 15m reversal=false, 3m reversal=true - actually 3m is bullish, so reversal is against? Clarify: reversal_signals indicate momentum moving AGAINST position. For LONG position, reversal means bearish signals. Here, htf_reversal=true (bearish), 3m_reversal=true (bearish? but 3m current_trend=BULLISH). Confusing. But loss_risk_signal=MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Given mixed signals and medium risk, consider closing LONG to avoid drawdown. Invalidation condition: If 3m price closes below 3m EMA20 (126.67). Current price=127.19 > 126.67, so not invalidated yet. But caution due to reversal signals.\n\nPOSITION_SLOTS: total_open=3, max_positions=4, long_slots_used=1, short_slots_used=2, long_slots_available=1, short_slots_available=0. Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE. Do NOT force LONG trades unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK. Only LINK has potential LONG, but not confident.\n\nOverall: Bearish regime, short performance better. Manage existing positions: Close DOGE due to volume violation, consider closing SOL due to reversal risk, hold XRP. No new entries due to slot constraints or lack of clear edge.",

Funding rate negative (-7.639e-05) supports bearish but volume invalidates.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.14 < EMA20=12.412, RSI=28.8), 15m BEARISH (price=12.07 < EMA20=12.131, RSI=38.9), 3m BEARISH (price=12.07 < EMA20=12.105, RSI=42.3). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.017 (WEAK, <0.20x) - HARD RULE: DO NOT TRADE due to extremely low volume. Funding rate negative (-6.123e-05) supports bearish but volume invalidates.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=126.77 < EMA20=129.520, RSI=28.9), 15m BEARISH (price=126.32 < EMA20=126.987, RSI=41.2), 3m BEARISH (price=126.32 < EMA20=126.921, RSI=37.6). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.774 (NORMAL, >0.20x) - acceptable volume. MACD on 3m shows positive divergence (0.028) but price still below EMA20. Funding rate negative (-6.854e-05) supports bearish. However, 3m RSI=37.6 not oversold enough for counter-trend LONG, and trend-following SHORT has weak momentum (MACD positive on 3m). No clear edge - better to HOLD.\n\nGLOBAL CONTEXT: Market regime BEARISH (6/6 coins bearish). Position slots: 4 available (2 long, 2 short). No cooldowns active. Short performance strong (4 consecutive wins, profitability 62.3%). Volume weakness pervasive across all coins except SOL. Discipline: Do not force trades when no clear edge exists. Holding cash is valid.\n\nCONCLUSION: All coins show bearish alignment but suffer from critically low volume (ratio <0.20x) except SOL. SOL has normal volume but mixed signals (bearish alignment but positive MACD on 3m). No high-confidence setups meet minimum volume requirement. Best action: HOLD all positions.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish with all coins in bearish market regimes. Position slots: short slots full (2 used, 0 available), long slots available (2). Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE, so only consider LONG entries if they are LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence; do not force SHORT trades. Counter-trade analysis is empty, no counter-trend opportunities identified. Trend reversal data shows no strong reversals against existing short positions (XRP and LINK have no reversal signals). Cooldown status: no directional or coin cooldowns. Volume analysis: ADA has weak volume (ratio 0.46), others normal or strong. Risk management: maintain at least 1:1.3 risk-reward, use 1h ATR for stops, and respect hard margin stop-loss at 3-7% loss.\n\nXRP: 1h bearish (price=2.0189 < EMA20=2.0788, RSI 24.5), 15m bearish (price=2.017 < EMA20=2.032, RSI 33.5), 3m bearish (price=2.0189 < EMA20=2.02, RSI 46.1). All timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume. Existing short position with unrealized PnL -0.22%. No reversal signals. Since short slots are full, cannot open new SHORT. LONG not viable due to bearish alignment and low confidence. Hold position.\n\nDOGE: 1h bearish (price=0.13537 < EMA20=0.1401, RSI 20.2), 15m bearish (price=0.13522 < EMA20=0.1365, RSI 29.0), 3m bearish (price=0.13537 < EMA20=0.1356, RSI 42.1). All timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume. Short slots full, so cannot open SHORT. LONG not viable due to bearish alignment. Hold.\n\nASTER: 1h bearish (price=0.929 < EMA20=1.0034, RSI 18.2), 15m bearish (price=0.924 < EMA20=0.9628, RSI 19.1), 3m bearish (price=0.929 < EMA20=0.9312, RSI 41.4). All timeframes aligned bearish with strong volume. Short slots full, so cannot open SHORT. LONG not viable due to bearish alignment. Trend reversal data shows 3m reversal with strength INFORMATIONAL, but this is against bearish trend and not strong enough for counter-trend LONG (risk likely HIGH_RISK). Hold.\n\nADA: 1h bearish (price=0.3793 < EMA20=0.3935, RSI 23.2), 15m bearish (price=0.3782 < EMA20=0.3819, RSI 31.4), 3m bullish (price=0.3793 > EMA20=0.3788, RSI 51.5). Mixed signals: 1h and 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume weak (ratio 0.46), caution applies. Trend reversal data shows 3m reversal with strength MEDIUM and MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. This suggests a potential counter-trend LONG opportunity (direction opposite to 1h trend). Risk level from counter-trade analysis not provided, but based on signals, likely MEDIUM_RISK. Since short slots are full, cannot open SHORT. LONG could be considered if confidence > 0.65. Analysis: 3m bullish but volume weak reduces confidence. RSI 51.5 neutral. Not a strong setup. Confidence estimated 0.5, below threshold. Hold.\n\nLINK: 1h bearish (price=12.07 < EMA20=12.4052, RSI 25.9), 15m bearish (price=12.05 < EMA20=12.1207, RSI 37.8), 3m bearish (price=12.07 < EMA20=12.077, RSI 46.8). All timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume. Existing short position with unrealized PnL -0.07%. No reversal signals. Since short slots are full, cannot open new SHORT. LONG not viable due to bearish alignment. Hold position.\n\nSOL: 1h bearish (price=126.63 < EMA20=129.5062, RSI 27.8), 15m bearish (price=126.51 < EMA20=126.9446, RSI 43.3), 3m bearish (price=126.62 < EMA20=126.726, RSI 46.2). All timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume. Short slots full, so cannot open SHORT. LONG not viable due to bearish alignment. Hold.\n\nOverall, no high-confidence LONG setups identified due to bearish regimes and weak signals. Existing short positions (XRP, LINK) should be held as reversal signals are absent. Do not force trades; holding cash is valid.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish with all coins in bearish market regimes. Position slots: short slots full (2 used, 0 available), long slots available (2). Constraint: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE, so only propose LONG entries if they are LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence; do not force SHORT entries. Counter-trade analysis is empty, so no explicit counter-trend signals. Trend reversal data: XRP has a short position with 3m reversal (strength MEDIUM) and current 3m trend bullish, but 1h bearish; LINK has no reversal signals; others have no or informational reversals. Volume is weak across all coins (ratio <0.5x), reducing confidence. Cooldowns: none active. Performance: short direction has been profitable, long direction less so. Analyze each coin:\n\nXRP: 1h bearish (price=2.0189 < EMA20=2.0788, RSI=24.5), 15m bearish (price=2.017 < EMA20=2.032, RSI=33.5), 3m mixed (price=2.0201 > EMA20=2.0198, RSI=48.3). Volume ratio=0.106 (WEAK). Existing short position with unrealized PnL -0.314. Reversal: 3m reversal strength MEDIUM against short position. Since short slots are full, cannot open new SHORT. For LONG, 3m shows bullish but 1h and 15m bearish, so counter-trend LONG would be HIGH_RISK (no alignment, weak volume). Do not trade; hold and monitor reversal.\n\nDOGE: 1h bearish (price=0.13537 < EMA20=0.1401, RSI=20.2), 15m bearish (price=0.13522 < EMA20=0.1365, RSI=29.0), 3m bearish (price=0.13522 < EMA20=0.1355, RSI=39.8). Volume ratio=0.236 (WEAK). All timeframes aligned bearish, but short slots full, so cannot open SHORT. For LONG, counter-trend would be VERY_HIGH_RISK (no bullish signals). Hold.\n\nASTER: 1h bearish (price=0.929 < EMA20=1.0034, RSI=18.2), 15m bearish (price=0.924 < EMA20=0.9628, RSI=19.1), 3m bearish (price=0.928 < EMA20=0.9305, RSI=40.9). Volume ratio=0.171 (WEAK). All timeframes aligned bearish, but short slots full. For LONG, counter-trend would be VERY_HIGH_RISK. Hold.\n\nADA: 1h bearish (price=0.3793 < EMA20=0.3935, RSI=23.2), 15m bearish (price=0.3782 < EMA20=0.3819, RSI=31.4), 3m mixed (price=0.3785 > EMA20=0.3787, RSI=46.8). Volume ratio=0.049 (WEAK, <0.20x, hard rule: DO NOT TRADE). Hold.\n\nLINK: 1h bearish (price=12.07 < EMA20=12.4052, RSI=25.9), 15m bearish (price=12.05 < EMA20=12.1207, RSI=37.8), 3m bearish (price=12.05 < EMA20=12.0721, RSI=42.9). Volume ratio=0.112 (WEAK). Existing short position with unrealized PnL +0.011. No reversal signals. Since short slots full, cannot open new SHORT. For LONG, counter-trend would be VERY_HIGH_RISK. Hold.\n\nSOL: 1h bearish (price=126.63 < EMA20=129.5062, RSI=27.8), 15m bearish (price=126.51 < EMA20=126.9446, RSI=43.3), 3m bearish (price=126.46 < EMA20=126.6801, RSI=42.7). Volume ratio=0.080 (WEAK, <0.20x, hard rule: DO NOT TRADE). All timeframes aligned bearish, but short slots full. For LONG, counter-trend would be VERY_HIGH_RISK. Hold.\n\nOverall, no valid LONG setups due to weak volume, high risk, or alignment issues. Short slots full, so no SHORT entries. Maintain discipline: holding cash is valid when no clear edge exists.",
