All three timeframes aligned bullish. Volume ratio 0.55x (NORMAL). Market condition TRENDING. Efficiency ratio 0.33. Strong trend-following LONG setup. Target 1.05 with stop below 1.01.

All three timeframes aligned bullish. Volume ratio 0.66x (NORMAL). Market condition TRENDING. Efficiency ratio 0.31. Strong trend-following LONG setup. Target 0.45 with stop below 0.43.

Volume ratio 0.45x (WEAK). Market condition TRENDING. No strong alignment; 3m reversal against bullish trend. Confidence low for entry.\n\nDecision: DOGE, ASTER, and ADA show strong bullish alignment across all timeframes with normal volume. LINK has volume weakness. XRP and SOL lack full alignment. Since max_positions=1, choose the best setup: DOGE has highest efficiency ratio (0.37) and strongest RSI alignment. Execute LONG on DOGE with high confidence.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing.\n\nXRP: 1h BULLISH (price=2.1677 > EMA20=2.113, RSI=73.46), 15m BULLISH (price=2.1667 > EMA20=2.163, RSI=58.31), 3m BEARISH (price=2.1626 < EMA20=2.1667, RSI=40.37). Timeframes conflict: 1h+15m bullish vs 3m bearish. Volume ratio=1.21 (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM, current_trend_3m=BEARISH. This is a counter-trend LONG opportunity (3m bearish but 1h+15m bullish). Risk_level from COUNTER_TRADE_ANALYSIS is not provided, but reversal strength=MEDIUM suggests MEDIUM_RISK. Confidence threshold for counter-trend is 0.65. Volume supports, but 3m bearish momentum persists. Long_slots_available=1, so can enter LONG. Set stop below recent support.\n\nDOGE: Has LONG position (unrealized_pnl=-0.61). 1h BULLISH (price=0.14701 > EMA20=0.14247, RSI=76.33), 15m BULLISH (price=0.14695 > EMA20=0.14595, RSI=67.16), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.14654 ≈ EMA20=0.14664, RSI=49.74). Timeframes mostly bullish but 3m shows weakness. Volume ratio=0.23 (WEAK) - caution. TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM against LONG position. According to exit_logic, MEDIUM reversal (only 3m) suggests continue monitoring, don't overreact. Position is in loss but thesis not invalidated (1h price > EMA20). HOLD.\n\nASTER: 1h BULLISH (price=1.023 > EMA20=0.9996, RSI=60.75), 15m BULLISH (price=1.021 > EMA20=1.0141, RSI=60.32), 3m BULLISH (price=1.023 > EMA20=1.0203, RSI=59.91). All three timeframes aligned bullish. Volume ratio=0.49 (WEAK) - reduces confidence. Market_condition=CHOPPY. No reversal signals. Long_slots_available=1, but weak volume and choppy market suggest lower edge. Confidence below min threshold of 0.4? Actually confidence could be around 0.5, but volume weakness is a caution. HOLD.\n\nADA: Has LONG position (unrealized_pnl=-0.34). 1h BULLISH (price=0.4377 > EMA20=0.4168, RSI=84.08), 15m BULLISH (price=0.438 > EMA20=0.4341, RSI=69.48), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4365 < EMA20=0.4369, RSI=47.68). Timeframes conflict: 1h+15m bullish vs 3m bearish. Volume ratio=1.03 (NORMAL). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM against LONG position. Similar to DOGE, MEDIUM reversal suggests continue monitoring. Position is in loss but thesis not invalidated (1h price > EMA20). HOLD.\n\nLINK: 1h BULLISH (price=13.52 > EMA20=12.9157, RSI=79.92), 15m BULLISH (price=13.53 > EMA20=13.3889, RSI=73.62), 3m BULLISH (price=13.55 > EMA20=13.4978, RSI=64.82). All three timeframes aligned bullish. Volume ratio=0.32 (WEAK) - reduces confidence. Market_condition=TRENDING. No reversal signals. Long_slots_available=1, but weak volume is a concern. Confidence may be around 0.6, but volume weakness suggests caution. HOLD.\n\nSOL: 1h BULLISH (price=139.26 > EMA20=134.8087, RSI=73.07), 15m BULLISH (price=139.23 > EMA20=139.009, RSI=57.76), 3m BEARISH (price=138.89 < EMA20=139.2955, RSI=38.66). Timeframes conflict: 1h+15m bullish vs 3m bearish. Volume ratio=0.46 (WEAK). TREND_REVERSAL shows 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM, current_trend_3m=BEARISH. This is a counter-trend LONG opportunity. Risk_level not provided, but reversal strength=MEDIUM suggests MEDIUM_RISK. Confidence threshold for counter-trend is 0.65. Volume is weak, reducing confidence. Long_slots_available=1, but weak volume and MEDIUM_RISK make edge questionable. HOLD.\n\nOverall: Global regime bullish. Position_slots: long_slots_used=2, long_slots_available=1, short_slots_available=3. No cooldowns. XRP offers the best counter-trend LONG setup with normal volume and MEDIUM_RISK. Others have weak volume or existing positions. Maintain discipline: do not force trades.",
