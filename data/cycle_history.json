All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume (0.45x). Counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK with 2 conditions met but volume weakness persists.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.411 > EMA20=0.41084, RSI 50.19), 15m BULLISH (price=0.411 > EMA20=0.40908, RSI 54.77), 3m BULLISH (price=0.411 > EMA20=0.40949, RSI 63.44).

All three timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume. Strong trend continuation setup.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.14658 > EMA20=0.14575, RSI 54.5), 15m BULLISH (price=0.14658 > EMA20=0.14580, RSI 56.7), 3m BULLISH (price=0.14619 > EMA20=0.14612, RSI 53.7). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume is weak (0.55x). Lower conviction due to weak participation.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.116 < EMA20=1.1244, RSI 46.2), 15m BEARISH (price=1.116 < EMA20=1.1191, RSI 45.4), 3m BEARISH (price=1.111 < EMA20=1.1163, RSI 40.8). All timeframes aligned bearish with strong volume (1.65x). Excellent short setup with oversold conditions providing good risk/reward.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.411 > EMA20=0.4108, RSI 50.2), 15m BULLISH (price=0.411 > EMA20=0.4091, RSI 54.8), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4096 > EMA20=0.4094, RSI 53.5). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume is very weak (0.49x). Weak participation reduces conviction.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=12.56 > EMA20=12.5435, RSI 51.5), 15m BULLISH (price=12.56 > EMA20=12.5122, RSI 54.5), 3m BEARISH (price=12.52 < EMA20=12.5308, RSI 49.6). Mixed signals - 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM_RISK with 3 conditions met, but volume is normal. Potential counter-trend short opportunity.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=130.35 < EMA20=130.69, RSI 48.5), 15m BULLISH (price=130.35 > EMA20=129.87, RSI 54.1), 3m BULLISH (price=129.98 > EMA20=129.96, RSI 52.2). Mixed regime - 1h bearish but 15m+3m bullish. Counter-trade analysis shows STRONG alignment for counter-trend LONG. My existing LONG position aligns with the counter-trend opportunity. Reversal signals show INFORMATIONAL strength against my position, but 15m+3m momentum supports holding.\n\n**PRIORITIZATION**: ASTER offers the strongest quantified edge with all timeframes aligned bearish and strong volume. XRP is strong trend-following bullish. LINK presents a valid counter-trend short opportunity. SOL position should be held given counter-trend alignment.",

Position is profitable (+$0.008). Reversal signals show only 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL) - normal noise. Volume extremely weak (0.048x) but trend structure intact. HOLD position.\n\n**DOGE Analysis:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.14658 > EMA20=0.14575, RSI=54.46)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.14658 > EMA20=0.14580, RSI=56.66)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=0.14615 > EMA20=0.14612, RSI=53.02)\nAll timeframes aligned bullish. Counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK with weak volume (0.088x). No counter-trend opportunity. Cannot open LONG (slots full). HOLD.\n\n**ASTER Analysis:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=1.116 < EMA20=1.12437, RSI=46.19)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=1.116 < EMA20=1.11909, RSI=45.40)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=1.111 < EMA20=1.11517, RSI=41.57)\nAll timeframes aligned bearish. Counter-trade shows VERY_HIGH_RISK with extremely weak volume (0.044x). Strong bearish momentum but volume concerns. SHORT slots available. However, volume ratio <0.05x is critically weak - insufficient participation for reliable entry. HOLD.\n\n**ADA Analysis:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=0.411 > EMA20=0.41084, RSI=50.19)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=0.411 > EMA20=0.40908, RSI=54.77)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.4093 < EMA20=0.40936, RSI=51.61)\nMixed signals: 1h+15m bullish, 3m bearish. Counter-trade shows MEDIUM_RISK opportunity for SHORT (3 conditions met). However, volume is critically weak (0.002x) - insufficient for reliable counter-trend entry. Cannot open LONG (slots full). HOLD.\n\n**LINK Analysis:**\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=12.56 > EMA20=12.54351, RSI=51.48)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=12.56 > EMA20=12.51220, RSI=54.55)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=12.51 < EMA20=12.52702, RSI=47.91)\nMixed signals: 1h+15m bullish, 3m bearish. Counter-trade shows MEDIUM_RISK opportunity for SHORT (3 conditions met). Volume extremely weak (0.01x) but better than ADA. SHORT slots available. This presents the best SHORT opportunity among available coins with counter-trend alignment.\n\n**SOL Analysis:**\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=130.35 < EMA20=130.68565, RSI=48.54)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=130.35 > EMA20=129.86873, RSI=54.13)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=130.05 > EMA20=129.96964, RSI=53.80)\nMixed signals with MEDIUM reversal strength. Position is losing (-$0.35). 1h bearish but 15m+3m bullish suggests potential recovery. Counter-trade shows STRONG alignment for LONG but cannot execute (slots full). HOLD position and monitor reversal signals.\n\n**Market Context:** Global regime neutral (2 bullish, 2 bearish, 2 neutral). All coins show extremely weak volume participation (<0.1x average), reducing conviction for new entries. Only LINK offers viable SHORT setup with counter-trend conditions and acceptable volume context.",

Current position slots: LONG slots FULL (2 used, 0 available), SHORT slots available (1 used, 1 available). Global regime is neutral with mixed signals across assets.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.0833 > EMA20=2.0619, RSI 57.4), 15m BULLISH (price=2.0835 > EMA20=2.0692, RSI 57.2), 3m BULLISH (price=2.0835 > EMA20=2.0834, RSI 53.3). All timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume. Existing LONG position slightly underwater but thesis intact. No reversal signals against position. HOLD.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.1459 > EMA20=0.1457, RSI 52.1), 15m BULLISH (price=0.1459 > EMA20=0.1457, RSI 51.0), 3m BEARISH (price=0.1459 < EMA20=0.1461, RSI 48.3). Mixed signals with 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM_RISK with 3 conditions met. However, volume is WEAK (0.25x avg) and LONG slots are FULL. Cannot enter LONG counter-trend. HOLD.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.109 < EMA20=1.1237, RSI 44.4), 15m BEARISH (price=1.109 < EMA20=1.1184, RSI 39.4), 3m BEARISH (price=1.109 < EMA20=1.1146, RSI 38.8). All timeframes aligned bearish with weak volume. Counter-trade conditions minimal (1 met). Strong bearish momentum but VERY_HIGH_RISK rating. SHORT slots available. Strong quantified edge for trend-following SHORT.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4084 < EMA20=0.4106, RSI 47.0), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4084 < EMA20=0.4088, RSI 47.7), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4084 < EMA20=0.4093, RSI 45.8). All timeframes aligned bearish but volume extremely WEAK (0.24x avg). VERY_HIGH_RISK counter-trade rating. Weak participation suggests poor conviction. HOLD.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=12.5 < EMA20=12.5378, RSI 48.8), 15m BEARISH (price=12.5 < EMA20=12.5065, RSI 48.6), 3m BEARISH (price=12.5 < EMA20=12.5253, RSI 46.2). All timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume. Existing SHORT position profitable. No reversal signals.

Position slots: 1 LONG available, 1 SHORT available. Current positions: XRP (LONG, -0.59 PnL), ASTER (SHORT, +0.13 PnL).\n\nXRP: 1h BULLISH (price=2.0795 > EMA20=2.0637, RSI 56.2), 15m BULLISH (price=2.0795 > EMA20=2.0703, RSI 55.1), 3m BEARISH (price=2.0795 < EMA20=2.0831, RSI 48.9). Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM alignment with 3 conditions met - this is a counter-trend SHORT opportunity. However, reversal signals show only 3m reversal (INFORMATIONAL) against my LONG position. Given the counter-trend signal and current loss, I'll close the XRP position.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.1453 < EMA20=0.1456, RSI 49.7), 15m BEARISH (price=0.1452 < EMA20=0.1457, RSI 46.2), 3m BEARISH (price=0.1452 < EMA20=0.1460, RSI 38.6). All timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume. Strong bearish momentum with oversold RSI on 3m. Valid trend-following SHORT opportunity.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.108 < EMA20=1.1220, RSI 44.3), 15m BEARISH (price=1.108 < EMA20=1.1172, RSI 39.6), 3m BEARISH (price=1.108 < EMA20=1.1137, RSI 39.2). All timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume. Position is profitable and thesis remains intact - hold.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4062 < EMA20=0.4101, RSI 44.3), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4062 < EMA20=0.4085, RSI 42.8), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4062 < EMA20=0.4089, RSI 35.3). All timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume. Strong bearish momentum with oversold RSI on 3m. Valid trend-following SHORT opportunity.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.42 < EMA20=12.5240, RSI 45.2), 15m BEARISH (price=12.41 < EMA20=12.4947, RSI 41.4), 3m BEARISH (price=12.41 < EMA20=12.5117, RSI 34.4). All timeframes aligned bearish with STRONG volume (2.1x ratio). Very strong bearish momentum with oversold RSI. Excellent trend-following SHORT opportunity.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=129.37 < EMA20=130.5095, RSI 44.1), 15m BEARISH (price=129.35 < EMA20=129.7685, RSI 44.0), 3m BEARISH (price=129.36 < EMA20=129.8935, RSI 39.0). All timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume. Bearish momentum with oversold RSI on 3m. Valid trend-following SHORT opportunity.\n\nGiven available SHORT slots (1) and multiple bearish opportunities, I'll prioritize LINK due to strongest volume confirmation and oversold momentum, then close XRP to free up capital. DOGE, ADA, and SOL also show strong bearish setups but I'll conserve the remaining SHORT slot for now.\n[Auto Exit Note: TP/SL or extended-loss closure executed before this analysis]",

CRITICAL: Cannot open new SHORT positions due to slot limits.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.0795 > EMA20=2.0637, RSI 56.2), 15m BULLISH (price=2.0795 > EMA20=2.0703, RSI 55.1), 3m BULLISH (price=2.0855 > EMA20=2.0836, RSI 55.1). All timeframes aligned bullish but volume extremely weak (0.10x). No counter-trend opportunity since all timeframes align. With no LONG slots available, cannot enter.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.1453 < EMA20=0.1456, RSI 49.7), 15m BEARISH (price=0.1452 < EMA20=0.1457, RSI 46.2), 3m BEARISH (price=0.1455 < EMA20=0.1459, RSI 42.4). All timeframes bearish with extremely weak volume (0.01x). Would consider SHORT but no SHORT slots available.\n\n**ASTER** (existing SHORT): 1h BEARISH (price=1.108 < EMA20=1.1220, RSI 44.3), 15m BEARISH (price=1.108 < EMA20=1.1172, RSI 39.6), 3m BEARISH (price=1.11 < EMA20=1.1129, RSI 43.3). Position slightly underwater (-$0.13) but all timeframes remain bearish. No reversal signals (only 3m reversal informational). Hold position with original exit plan.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4062 < EMA20=0.4101, RSI 44.3), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4062 < EMA20=0.4085, RSI 42.8), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4072 < EMA20=0.4086, RSI 41.6). All timeframes bearish with very weak volume (0.03x).

All timeframes bearish with weak volume (0.09x). Would consider SHORT but no SHORT slots available.\n\n**COUNTER-TRADE ANALYSIS**: No valid counter-trend opportunities identified. All coins show alignment between 1h and 15m+3m trends. XRP is the only bullish coin but cannot enter LONG due to slot constraints.\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION**: With SHORT slots full and no valid counter-trend LONG opportunities, must HOLD existing positions and wait for better setups.

Must focus on LONG opportunities or hold.\n\n**XRP ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=2.0795 > EMA20=2.0637, RSI=56.2, MACD positive)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=2.0777 > EMA20=2.0712, RSI=54.1, MACD positive)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=2.0777 < EMA20=2.0823, RSI=46.1 oversold)\n- Counter-trade: 3/5 conditions met, MEDIUM_RISK, but volume extremely weak (0.11x avg)\n- All timeframes align BULLISH except 3m showing temporary pullback\n- Strong LONG setup with 1h+15m bullish alignment, 3m oversold provides entry opportunity\n\n**DOGE ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.1453 < EMA20=0.1456, RSI=49.7, MACD positive but weak)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.1451 < EMA20=0.1456, RSI=45.2)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.1451 < EMA20=0.1457, RSI=36.9 oversold)\n- All timeframes bearish, no counter-trade alignment\n- Volume extremely weak (0.15x avg) - avoid\n\n**ASTER ANALYSIS** (EXISTING SHORT):\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=1.108 < EMA20=1.122, RSI=44.3, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=1.106 < EMA20=1.1161, RSI=38.1)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=1.106 < EMA20=1.111, RSI=37.4 oversold)\n- Position: SHORT, +0.40 PnL, all timeframes support bearish thesis\n- HOLD - trend remains bearish, position profitable\n\n**ADA ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.4062 < EMA20=0.4101, RSI=44.3, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.4063 < EMA20=0.4083, RSI=43.0)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=0.4063 < EMA20=0.4079, RSI=37.1 oversold)\n- All timeframes bearish, no counter-trade alignment\n- Volume extremely weak (0.06x avg) - avoid\n\n**LINK ANALYSIS** (EXISTING SHORT):\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=12.42 < EMA20=12.524, RSI=45.2, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=12.44 < EMA20=12.493, RSI=43.5)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=12.44 < EMA20=12.4833, RSI=39.5)\n- Position: SHORT, -0.54 PnL, but all timeframes support bearish thesis\n- HOLD - trend remains bearish, small loss within normal fluctuation\n\n**SOL ANALYSIS**:\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=129.37 < EMA20=130.51, RSI=44.1, MACD negative)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=129.56 < EMA20=129.78, RSI=45.8)\n- 3m: BEARISH (price=129.56 < EMA20=129.78, RSI=43.5)\n- All timeframes bearish, no counter-trade alignment\n- Volume extremely weak (0.04x avg) - avoid\n\n**STRATEGY**: With SHORT slots full, only LONG opportunities viable.

Current market regime is neutral (1 bullish, 2 bearish, 3 neutral coins) with weak volume across all assets. Position slots: 1 LONG available, 0 SHORT available (SHORT_FULL constraint). Must prioritize quality LONG setups only.\n\nXRP: 1h BULLISH (price=2.0795 > EMA20=2.0637, RSI 56.2), 15m BULLISH (price=2.0777 > EMA20=2.0712, RSI 54.1), 3m BEARISH (price=2.077 < EMA20=2.0819, RSI 45.3). Mixed signals - 1h+15m bullish but 3m bearish. Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM alignment with 3 conditions met but VERY WEAK volume (0.19x). Existing LONG position slightly negative (-$0.05). Reversal signal: only 3m bearish (INFORMATIONAL). Given weak volume and mixed momentum, better to hold and monitor.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.14529 < EMA20=0.14564, RSI 49.7), 15m BEARISH (price=0.14509 < EMA20=0.14561, RSI 45.2), 3m BEARISH (price=0.14494 < EMA20=0.14559, RSI 34.7). All timeframes bearish with oversold RSI on 3m. Counter-trade conditions weak (1 met), volume weak (0.39x). No SHORT slots available, so cannot enter. No counter-trend LONG opportunity since 15m+3m are bearish.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.108 < EMA20=1.1220, RSI 44.3), 15m BEARISH (price=1.106 < EMA20=1.1161, RSI 38.1), 3m BEARISH (price=1.103 < EMA20=1.1100, RSI 33.5). All timeframes bearish with oversold conditions. Existing SHORT position profitable (+$0.79). Volume weak (0.46x). Continue holding as bearish momentum persists.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4062 < EMA20=0.4101, RSI 44.3), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4063 < EMA20=0.4083, RSI 43.0), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4057 < EMA20=0.4076, RSI 34.1). All timeframes bearish with oversold RSI. Volume very weak (0.29x). No SHORT slots available. No counter-trend LONG opportunity since 15m+3m are bearish.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=12.42 < EMA20=12.5240, RSI 45.2), 15m BEARISH (price=12.44 < EMA20=12.4930, RSI 43.5), 3m BEARISH (price=12.42 < EMA20=12.4773, RSI 36.4). All timeframes bearish. Existing SHORT position slightly negative (-$0.18). Volume extremely weak (0.046x) - concerning. Continue monitoring but weak volume suggests limited conviction.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=129.37 < EMA20=130.5095, RSI 44.1), 15m BEARISH (price=129.56 < EMA20=129.7779, RSI 45.8), 3m BEARISH (price=129.48 < EMA20=129.7493, RSI 41.6). All timeframes bearish. Volume weak (0.21x). No SHORT slots available. No counter-trend LONG opportunity since 15m+3m are bearish.\n\nGiven SHORT_FULL constraint and weak volume across all assets, no high-quality LONG setups available.

Current LONG position is slightly underwater but 1h trend remains bullish. 3m reversal signal is INFORMATIONAL only - continue monitoring.\n\n**DOGE**:\n- 1h BEARISH (price=0.14529 < EMA20=0.14564, RSI 49.7)\n- 15m BEARISH momentum (price=0.14509 < EMA20=0.14561, RSI 45.2)\n- 3m BEARISH (price=0.14498 < EMA20=0.14555, RSI 36.5)\nAll timeframes aligned bearish.

Current SHORT position is profitable (+0.53 PnL). No reversal signals.

Volume is WEAK (0.43x average) which reduces conviction. RSI oversold at 36.6 but no clear reversal signals.\n\n**LINK**:\n- 1h BEARISH (price=12.42 < EMA20=12.5240, RSI 45.2)\n- 15m BEARISH momentum (price=12.44 < EMA20=12.4930, RSI 43.5)\n- 3m BEARISH (price=12.44 < EMA20=12.4763, RSI 40.3)\nAll timeframes aligned bearish.

Volume normal, RSI neutral. No counter-trade opportunity.\n\n**POSITION SLOTS CONSTRAINT**: SHORT_FULL_LONG_AVAILABLE (1 LONG slot available, 0 SHORT slots available). Cannot open new SHORT positions. Only LONG entries allowed.\n\n**XRP COUNTER-TRADE OPPORTUNITY**: 1h BULLISH but 15m+3m BEARISH creates counter-trend SHORT opportunity. However, SHORT slots are FULL (0 available), so cannot execute. The existence of this valid counter-trend signal invalidates any trend-following LONG setup on XRP.\n\n**MARKET CONTEXT**: Global regime NEUTRAL with 1 bullish, 2 bearish, 3 neutral coins. Short performance strong (+1.21 PnL, 100% win rate) vs long performance weak (-1.17 PnL, 0% win rate).\n\nGiven the constraints and analysis, no new entries meet criteria. XRP counter-trend opportunity exists but cannot execute due to short slot limit. All other coins show bearish alignment but short slots are full. Best action: HOLD existing positions and monitor for slot availability changes.",

ADA and LINK are in cooldown, so no trades on those coins.\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.0795 > EMA20=2.0637, RSI 56.2), 15m BULLISH (price=2.0785 > EMA20=2.0713, RSI 54.1), 3m BULLISH (price=2.0937 > EMA20=2.0829, RSI 60.8). All three timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume. Strong trend-following setup.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.14529 < EMA20=0.14564, RSI 49.7), 15m BEARISH (price=0.14515 < EMA20=0.14553, RSI 46.5), 3m BULLISH (price=0.14642 > EMA20=0.14562, RSI 60.8).

Position slots: SHORT_FULL (2/2 short slots used), LONG_AVAILABLE (0/2 long slots used). Critical constraint: Cannot open new SHORT positions, only LONG or counter-trend LONG opportunities.\n\n**XRP**: \n- 1h BULLISH (price=2.0795 > EMA20=2.0637, RSI 56.2)\n- 15m BULLISH (price=2.0785 > EMA20=2.0713, RSI 54.1) \n- 3m BULLISH (price=2.083 > EMA20=2.0826, RSI 51.0)\nAll timeframes aligned BULLISH with weak volume (0.10x). Strong trend-following setup but requires LONG slots which are available. However, volume weakness reduces conviction.\n\n**DOGE**:\n- 1h BEARISH (price=0.14529 < EMA20=0.14564, RSI 49.7)\n- 15m BEARISH (price=0.14515 < EMA20=0.14553, RSI 46.5)\n- 3m BULLISH (price=0.14576 > EMA20=0.14564, RSI 51.3)\nMixed signals: 1h+15m BEARISH, 3m BULLISH. Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM_RISK with 3/5 conditions met. However, counter-trend direction would be LONG (15m+3m BULLISH) but 15m is actually BEARISH, so not valid counter-trend. Coin in cooldown - avoid.\n\n**ASTER** (existing SHORT):\n- 1h BEARISH (price=1.108 < EMA20=1.1220, RSI 44.3)\n- 15m BEARISH (price=1.106 < EMA20=1.1146, RSI 40.8)\n- 3m BEARISH (price=1.11 < EMA20=1.1103, RSI 48.8)\nAll timeframes aligned BEARISH. Position is profitable (+0.15). No reversal signals (3m reversal is NONE). Hold position - thesis remains valid.\n\n**ADA** (existing SHORT):\n- 1h BEARISH (price=0.4062 < EMA20=0.4101, RSI 44.3)\n- 15m BEARISH (price=0.4066 < EMA20=0.4081, RSI 44.7)\n- 3m BULLISH (price=0.4087 > EMA20=0.4081, RSI 52.2)\nMixed: 1h+15m BEARISH, 3m BULLISH. Position is profitable (+0.11). INFORMATIONAL reversal signal (3m only). Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM_RISK with 3/5 conditions met. However, counter-trend direction would be LONG (15m+3m BULLISH) but 15m is BEARISH, so not valid counter-trend. Hold position.\n\n**LINK**:\n- 1h BEARISH (price=12.42 < EMA20=12.524, RSI 45.2)\n- 15m BEARISH (price=12.44 < EMA20=12.4836, RSI 44.9)\n- 3m BULLISH (price=12.5 > EMA20=12.4912, RSI 50.9)\nMixed: 1h+15m BEARISH, 3m BULLISH. Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM_RISK with 3/5 conditions met. Counter-trend direction would be LONG (15m+3m BULLISH) but 15m is BEARISH, so not valid counter-trend. Weak volume (0.39x). No compelling LONG setup.\n\n**SOL**:\n- 1h BEARISH (price=129.37 < EMA20=130.51, RSI 44.1)\n- 15m BEARISH (price=129.61 < EMA20=129.72, RSI 47.3)\n- 3m BULLISH (price=130.37 > EMA20=130.02, RSI 55.3)\nMixed: 1h+15m BEARISH, 3m BULLISH. Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM_RISK with 3/5 conditions met. Counter-trend direction would be LONG (15m+3m BULLISH) but 15m is BEARISH, so not valid counter-trend. Weak volume (0.23x). No compelling LONG setup.\n\n**DECISION RATIONALE**: With SHORT slots full and no valid counter-trend LONG opportunities (all require 15m+3m BULLISH alignment, but 15m trends remain BEARISH), the only option is to hold existing positions. Both ASTER and ADA shorts are profitable and aligned with 1h+15m bearish trends. No new entries meet criteria given slot constraints and weak volume across all coins.",

Counter-trade analysis shows STRONG alignment for counter-trend SHORT (1h bullish vs 15m+3m bearish). Position is profitable (+1.26 PnL) but reversal signals show MEDIUM strength (htf reversal + 3m reversal against short). Given 1h bullish structure, consider closing short to lock profits.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.14529 < EMA20=0.14564, RSI 49.7), 15m BEARISH (price=0.14488 < EMA20=0.14540, RSI 45.1), 3m BEARISH (price=0.14305 < EMA20=0.14519, RSI 30.2). All timeframes aligned bearish with STRONG volume (3.38x). RSI extremely oversold at 30.2. Counter-trade conditions weak (only 1 met). Strong bearish momentum but oversold conditions suggest potential bounce.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.108 < EMA20=1.1220, RSI 44.3), 15m BEARISH (price=1.108 < EMA20=1.1137, RSI 43.0), 3m BEARISH (price=1.099 < EMA20=1.1084, RSI 39.6). All timeframes bearish with STRONG volume (2.53x). RSI oversold at 39.6. Counter-trade conditions show 2 met but VERY_HIGH_RISK. Bearish momentum intact.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4062 < EMA20=0.4101, RSI 44.3), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4062 < EMA20=0.4077, RSI 44.3), 3m BEARISH (price=0.4025 < EMA20=0.4071, RSI 35.4). All timeframes bearish with NORMAL volume. RSI oversold at 35.4. No counter-trade conditions met. Bearish structure remains.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=12.42 < EMA20=12.524, RSI 45.2), 15m BEARISH (price=12.44 < EMA20=12.476, RSI 45.2), 3m BEARISH (price=12.32 < EMA20=12.4618, RSI 36.4). All timeframes bearish with STRONG volume (2.25x). RSI oversold at 36.4. Counter-trade conditions show 1 met. Bearish momentum continues.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=129.37 < EMA20=130.51, RSI 44.1), 15m BULLISH (price=129.82 > EMA20=129.71, RSI 49.7), 3m BEARISH (price=128.71 < EMA20=129.79, RSI 39.1).

Strong counter-trend SHORT opportunity but cannot execute due to short slots full. Current SHORT position shows 1h reversal signal (price > EMA20) but position is minimal loss. Given 1h bullish structure and counter-trend alignment, should close SHORT position.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.14419 < EMA20=0.1455, RSI 45.7), 15m BEARISH (price=0.14487 < EMA20=0.1454, RSI 45.0), 3m BEARISH (price=0.14485 < EMA20=0.1450, RSI 47.2). All timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume. Current SHORT position aligns with trend but showing minor unrealized loss. No reversal signals. Should hold position.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.107 < EMA20=1.1219, RSI 44.0), 15m BEARISH (price=1.111 < EMA20=1.1140, RSI 45.8), 3m BULLISH (price=1.111 > EMA20=1.1088, RSI 51.5). Mixed signals with weak volume (0.36x). Medium counter-trend LONG opportunity but volume weakness reduces confidence. Not compelling enough for LONG entry.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.406 < EMA20=0.4101, RSI 44.1), 15m BEARISH (price=0.4073 < EMA20=0.4078, RSI 47.2), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4073 > EMA20=0.4070, RSI 50.2). Medium counter-trend LONG opportunity but very weak volume (0.28x) makes setup unreliable. Skip.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BEARISH (price=12.45 < EMA20=12.5269, RSI 46.6), 15m BULLISH (price=12.49 > EMA20=12.4808, RSI 49.8), 3m BULLISH (price=12.49 > EMA20=12.4672, RSI 51.7). Strong counter-trend LONG opportunity with normal volume. 15m+3m bullish alignment against 1h bearish trend. RSI neutral but improving momentum.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BEARISH (price=129.8 < EMA20=130.5505, RSI 46.0), 15m BULLISH (price=130.4 > EMA20=129.7685, RSI 54.9), 3m BULLISH (price=130.4 > EMA20=129.8961, RSI 55.0). Strong counter-trend LONG opportunity with normal volume. All shorter timeframes bullish with RSI above 50, MACD positive on 3m.\n\n**Priority Actions**: Close XRP SHORT (counter-trend invalidates position), open LINK and SOL LONG positions (strong counter-trend setups with available LONG slots), hold DOGE SHORT (trend-aligned).",

Strong counter-trend LONG opportunity (3 conditions met, LOW_RISK). Currently holding LONG position at -1.07 PnL. Reversal signals show MEDIUM strength (htf+3m bearish) but position is short-duration (7 min). Volume weak (0.28x). Will hold and monitor exit plan.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4101 < EMA20=0.4103, RSI 49.48), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4101 > EMA20=0.4082, RSI 53.68), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4099 > EMA20=0.4080, RSI 56.31). Strong counter-trend LONG opportunity (3 conditions met, LOW_RISK). Volume weak (0.35x) but technical setup favorable.

All timeframes aligned bullish but volume weak (0.50x). No counter-trade opportunity (alignment_strength null, VERY_HIGH_RISK).

All timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume. No counter-trade opportunity (alignment_strength null, VERY_HIGH_RISK). LONG slots available but trend-following only.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.119 < EMA20=1.1223, RSI 47.8), 15m BEARISH (price=1.113 < EMA20=1.1143, RSI 47.6), 3m BULLISH (price=1.113 > EMA20=1.1113, RSI 52.0). Counter-trade LONG opportunity with MEDIUM alignment strength (3 conditions met, MEDIUM_RISK). However, ASTER is in cooldown (1 cycle remaining) - cannot trade.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4101 < EMA20=0.4103, RSI 49.5), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4096 > EMA20=0.4081, RSI 52.6), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4096 > EMA20=0.4081, RSI 55.5). STRONG counter-trade LONG opportunity (3 conditions met, LOW_RISK). Currently have LONG position with slight loss (-$0.16). Reversal signals show HTF reversal but position is new (3 minutes). Volume normal. Hold position as counter-trade thesis remains valid.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=12.58 > EMA20=12.5388, RSI 52.8), 15m BULLISH (price=12.54 > EMA20=12.4899, RSI 53.7), 3m BULLISH (price=12.54 > EMA20=12.503, RSI 54.3).

LONG cooldown active (3 cycles remaining) - cannot open new LONG positions. ADA counter-trade is valid but cannot add due to LONG cooldown.

Short performance strong (net PnL +2.94, win rate 61%) while long performance weak (net PnL -0.25, win rate 49%). LONG cooldown active prevents new long entries despite valid counter-trade signals.\n\n**DECISION**: Hold ADA position as counter-trade thesis remains valid. No new entries due to LONG cooldown and no valid SHORT counter-trade opportunities. Wait for cooldown to expire or market conditions to shift.",

BEARISH regime. All timeframes aligned bearish except 3m showing temporary bullish. Strong trend-following SHORT opportunity.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4101 < EMA20=0.4103, RSI 49.5), 15m BEARISH (price=0.408 < EMA20=0.4082, RSI 48.6), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4115 > EMA20=0.4091, RSI 58.3). Existing LONG position. Reversal signals: STRONG reversal (1h+15m+3m all bearish against LONG position). Position is slightly negative (-$0.19).

Consider closing given bullish pressure.\n\n**ASTER** (SHORT POSITION):\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=1.119 < EMA20=1.1223, RSI 47.8)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=1.104 < EMA20=1.1126, RSI 41.1)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=1.119 > EMA20=1.1123, RSI 59.1)\nStrong bearish structure on 1h+15m, but 3m showing bullish momentum. Position slightly negative (-$0.30). Reversal signal only INFORMATIONAL. Thesis remains valid.\n\n**ADA**:\n- 1h: BEARISH (price=0.4101 < EMA20=0.4103, RSI 49.5)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=0.408 < EMA20=0.4082, RSI 48.6)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=0.4126 > EMA20=0.4097, RSI 61.2)\nCounter-trade opportunity: 1h bearish but 15m+3m bullish = counter-trend LONG. Conditions met: 3/5, MEDIUM_RISK. However, volume extremely weak (0.11x). Confidence insufficient for counter-trend.\n\n**LINK**:\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=12.58 > EMA20=12.5388, RSI 52.8)\n- 15m: BEARISH (price=12.49 < EMA20=12.4932, RSI 49.1)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=12.63 > EMA20=12.5445, RSI 60.3)\nMixed signals - 1h bullish but 15m bearish. Volume extremely weak (0.08x). Counter-trade analysis shows MEDIUM alignment but HIGH_RISK. Not compelling.\n\n**SOL** (LONG POSITION):\n- 1h: BULLISH (price=131.09 > EMA20=130.68, RSI 52.1)\n- 15m: BULLISH (price=130.49 > EMA20=130.04, RSI 53.8)\n- 3m: BULLISH (price=131.7 > EMA20=130.91, RSI 61.1)\nStrong bullish alignment across all timeframes! Position profitable (+$0.23). Hold with confidence.\n\n**DECISION RATIONALE**:\n- No compelling LONG entries due to weak volume and mixed signals\n- DOGE short under pressure from bullish momentum - close to free up short slot\n- ASTER short thesis remains valid despite minor 3m pressure\n- SOL long strong across all timeframes - hold\n- With short slots full and no quality long setups, conservative approach warranted",

All timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume. However, counter-trade analysis shows VERY_HIGH_RISK with only 1 condition met. No reversal signals present.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h NEUTRAL (price=0.14576 ≈ EMA20=0.14566, RSI 51.6), 15m BULLISH (price=0.14726 > EMA20=0.14577, RSI 60.2), 3m BULLISH (price=0.14726 > EMA20=0.14591, RSI 64.8). Mixed signals with 1h neutral but shorter timeframes bullish. Counter-trade shows VERY_HIGH_RISK. SHORT direction in cooldown (3 cycles remaining).\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.119 < EMA20=1.1223, RSI 47.8), 15m BULLISH (price=1.125 > EMA20=1.1154, RSI 56.3), 3m BULLISH (price=1.125 > EMA20=1.1138, RSI 64.9). Strong counter-trend LONG opportunity with STRONG alignment and LOW_RISK rating. However, ASTER is in cooldown (1 cycle remaining) - cannot trade.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4101 < EMA20=0.4103, RSI 49.5), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4141 > EMA20=0.4092, RSI 61.0), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4142 > EMA20=0.4102, RSI 64.9). Strong counter-trend LONG opportunity with STRONG alignment and LOW_RISK rating. All timeframes except 1h show bullish momentum with normal volume.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=12.58 > EMA20=12.5388, RSI 52.8), 15m BULLISH (price=12.66 > EMA20=12.522, RSI 61.0), 3m BULLISH (price=12.66 > EMA20=12.5563, RSI 62.6). All timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume. Counter-trade shows VERY_HIGH_RISK.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=131.09 > EMA20=130.68, RSI 52.1), 15m BULLISH (price=132.33 > EMA20=130.39, RSI 65.5), 3m BULLISH (price=132.31 > EMA20=131.07, RSI 65.8). All timeframes aligned bullish with strong volume (ratio 1.24x). Position is profitable (+$0.76) and shows no concerning reversal signals (only informational 3m reversal). Continue holding.\n\n**POSITION SLOTS ANALYSIS**: 1 LONG slot used (SOL), 1 LONG slot available, 2 SHORT slots available. SHORT direction in cooldown (3 cycles) - cannot open new SHORT positions. ASTER in cooldown - cannot trade ASTER.\n\n**PRIORITIZATION**: ADA presents the strongest counter-trend LONG opportunity with LOW_RISK rating and STRONG alignment. All technical conditions support a LONG entry with 1h bearish but 15m+3m strongly bullish. XRP, LINK, DOGE show trend-following setups but with VERY_HIGH_RISK ratings. SOL position performing well - continue holding.",

All timeframes aligned bullish but volume ratio 0.30x is very weak. No counter-trade opportunity (all timeframes bullish). Weak volume reduces conviction.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h NEUTRAL (price=0.14576 ≈ EMA20=0.14566, RSI 51.6), 15m BULLISH (price=0.14726 > EMA20=0.14577, RSI 60.2), 3m BULLISH (price=0.14718 > EMA20=0.14604, RSI 63.0). Mixed signals with 1h neutral but shorter timeframes bullish. No strong counter-trade setup.

STRONG counter-trade LONG opportunity with 3 conditions met, LOW_RISK rating. 15m+3m both bullish against 1h bearish trend. Volume normal, RSI neutral.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4101 < EMA20=0.4103, RSI 49.5), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4141 > EMA20=0.4092, RSI 61.0), 3m BULLISH (price=0.414 > EMA20=0.4106, RSI 63.1). Existing LONG position showing slight unrealized loss. STRONG counter-trade LONG setup confirmed. Volume strong at 1.14x average. Position should be held given strong counter-trade conditions.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=12.58 > EMA20=12.5388, RSI 52.8), 15m BULLISH (price=12.66 > EMA20=12.522, RSI 61.0), 3m BULLISH (price=12.66 > EMA20=12.5671, RSI 62.0).

All timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume. Strong trend-following LONG setup.\n\n**POSITION SLOTS ANALYSIS**: 1 LONG slot used (ADA), 1 LONG slot available, 2 SHORT slots available. STRONG counter-trade opportunities in ASTER and ADA. Given short cooldown (2 cycles) and poor short performance history, focus on LONG opportunities.\n\n**PRIORITIZATION**: ASTER counter-trade LONG (LOW_RISK, strong setup), LINK trend-following LONG (strong alignment), SOL trend-following LONG (strong alignment).

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Analyzing all assets systematically using multi-timeframe analysis:\n\n**XRP**: 1h BULLISH (price=2.089 > EMA20=2.0657, RSI 58.1), 15m BULLISH (price=2.0924 > EMA20=2.0749, RSI 58.8), 3m BULLISH (price=2.0924 > EMA20=2.0845, RSI 58.0). All timeframes aligned bullish with STRONG volume (1.55x ratio). However, LONG slots are FULL (0 available), so cannot enter new long positions despite strong bullish alignment.\n\n**DOGE**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.14689 > EMA20=0.1458, RSI 55.7), 15m BULLISH (price=0.14689 > EMA20=0.1457, RSI 58.1), 3m BULLISH (price=0.14689 > EMA20=0.1462, RSI 59.1). All timeframes bullish but volume WEAK (0.22x ratio). LONG slots FULL, cannot enter.\n\n**ASTER**: 1h BEARISH (price=1.119 < EMA20=1.1223, RSI 47.8), 15m BULLISH (price=1.121 > EMA20=1.115, RSI 53.6), 3m BULLISH (price=1.121 > EMA20=1.1159, RSI 58.4). Existing LONG position showing +0.37 PnL. Counter-trade analysis shows STRONG alignment (3 conditions met) for LONG with LOW_RISK rating. 1h bearish but 15m+3m bullish creates counter-trend LONG opportunity. However, position already exists and LONG slots FULL.\n\n**ADA**: 1h BULLISH (price=0.4127 > EMA20=0.4106, RSI 52.8), 15m BULLISH (price=0.413 > EMA20=0.4091, RSI 59.1), 3m BULLISH (price=0.413 > EMA20=0.4112, RSI 58.8). Existing LONG position showing -0.68 PnL. All timeframes bullish with NORMAL volume. Position should be held as thesis remains valid.\n\n**LINK**: 1h BULLISH (price=12.61 > EMA20=12.5417, RSI 54.1), 15m BULLISH (price=12.63 > EMA20=12.5191, RSI 58.9), 3m BULLISH (price=12.63 > EMA20=12.5794, RSI 57.8). All timeframes bullish but volume extremely WEAK (0.07x ratio). LONG slots FULL, cannot enter.\n\n**SOL**: 1h BULLISH (price=131.94 > EMA20=130.7647, RSI 55.6), 15m BULLISH (price=131.9 > EMA20=130.3487, RSI 62.9), 3m BULLISH (price=131.9 > EMA20=131.3751, RSI 59.2). All timeframes bullish but volume WEAK (0.43x ratio). LONG slots FULL, cannot enter.\n\n**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: LONG slots are FULL (0 available), SHORT slots available (2). However, market regime is strongly bullish (4/6 coins bullish) with no valid counter-trend SHORT opportunities. ASTER shows counter-trend LONG opportunity but cannot execute due to slot limits. According to rules: \"If you identify a valid counter-trend opportunity but cannot execute it due to limits, you MUST NOT open a trend-following trade in the opposite direction.\" Therefore, no new SHORT entries despite available slots.\n\n**PORTFOLIO STATUS**: 2 LONG positions (ADA -0.68, ASTER +0.37), total account value $99.98. Both positions should be held as their theses remain valid. ADA shows reversal signals but only 3m level, not concerning. ASTER counter-trend LONG working well.",
