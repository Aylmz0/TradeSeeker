Strong counter-trade setup with 15m+3m aligned bullish against 1h bearish trend. Volume ratio=1.88 (STRONG) confirms conviction. Open Interest high, funding slightly negative. Strong quantified edge for LONG counter-trend. Targeting $2.22 with stop below $2.15. Invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH, 15m BEARISH, 3m BEARISH. All timeframes aligned bearish. Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL positive. Volume ratio=1.18 (NORMAL). No reversal signals against position (3m reversal=INFORMATIONAL only). Continue holding SHORT with existing exit plan.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH, 15m BEARISH, 3m BEARISH. All timeframes aligned bearish. Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL negative but small. Volume ratio=0.33 (WEAK) reduces conviction. No strong reversal signals. Continue monitoring but hold position given bearish alignment.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4164 < EMA20=0.4189, RSI=40.9), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4164 > EMA20=0.4161, RSI=50.6), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4165 > EMA20=0.4164, RSI=54.0). Counter-trade setup with 15m+3m aligned bullish against 1h bearish. Volume ratio=0.36 (WEAK) significantly reduces confidence. Funding slightly negative. Weak volume makes this marginal; skipping due to low conviction.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=13.12 < EMA20=13.1481, RSI=45.9), 15m BULLISH (price=13.12 > EMA20=13.0978, RSI=54.5), 3m BULLISH (price=13.12 > EMA20=13.1129, RSI=55.3). Counter-trade setup with 15m+3m aligned bullish against 1h bearish. Volume ratio=0.55 (NORMAL). Funding positive. Moderate confidence for LONG counter-trend. Targeting $13.35 with stop below $12.90. Invalidation if 1h price closes above EMA20.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH, 15m BEARISH, 3m BEARISH. All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume ratio=0.38 (WEAK) reduces conviction. No strong signals for entry. Holding.\n\nPOSITION SLOTS: Short slots full (2 used), Long slots available (2). Valid counter-trend LONG signals exist for XRP and LINK.

Strong counter-trend LONG setup with 15m+3m aligned bullish against 1h bearish trend. Volume ratio 1.72x (STRONG) supports conviction. However, existing LONG position with 7.3min duration shows MEDIUM reversal risk (htf_reversal=true, 3m_reversal=true). Position currently profitable (+0.42 PnL). Given counter-trade alignment and strong volume, maintain position but monitor reversal signals closely. Invalidation if 1h price closes below EMA20 (2.1873).\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.14904 < EMA20=0.1500, RSI 41.2), 15m BEARISH (price=0.14914 < EMA20=0.1493, RSI 43.7), 3m BEARISH (price=0.14907 < EMA20=0.1491, RSI 48.0). All timeframes aligned bearish for trend-following SHORT. Volume ratio 0.31x (WEAK) reduces confidence. Existing SHORT position with 79min duration shows LOW reversal risk (only 3m_reversal=true, strength=INFORMATIONAL). Position profitable (+0.19 PnL). Maintain SHORT with weak volume noted.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.083 < EMA20=1.0951, RSI 41.4), 15m BEARISH (price=1.083 < EMA20=1.0929, RSI 29.8), 3m BULLISH (price=1.085 > EMA20=1.0849, RSI 47.4). Mixed signals with 1h+15m bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio 0.14x (WEAK) very low. Existing SHORT position with 43min duration shows MEDIUM reversal risk (3m_reversal=true) and is losing (-0.47 PnL). Weak volume and mixed momentum suggest closing position to avoid further loss.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4164 < EMA20=0.4189, RSI 40.9), 15m BULLISH (price=0.417 > EMA20=0.4162, RSI 53.4), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4169 > EMA20=0.4167, RSI 54.7). Strong counter-trend LONG setup with 15m+3m aligned bullish against 1h bearish. Volume ratio 0.11x (WEAK) significantly reduces confidence. Existing LONG position with 3.4min duration shows LOW reversal risk (htf_reversal=true, 3m_reversal=true, strength=INFORMATIONAL). Position slightly losing (-0.05 PnL). Weak volume makes this high-risk; consider closing.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=13.12 < EMA20=13.1481, RSI 45.9), 15m BULLISH (price=13.1 > EMA20=13.0980, RSI 50.0), 3m BEARISH (price=13.11 < EMA20=13.1119, RSI 50.7). Mixed signals with no clear alignment. Volume ratio 0.08x (WEAK) extremely low. No position. No strong edge for entry; hold.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=136.85 < EMA20=137.7218, RSI 39.2), 15m BEARISH (price=136.8 < EMA20=136.9572, RSI 44.7), 3m BULLISH (price=136.86 > EMA20=136.8374, RSI 51.0). Mixed signals with 1h+15m bearish vs 3m bullish. Volume ratio 0.79x (NORMAL). No position. MEDIUM reversal risk (3m_reversal=true) but no clear entry edge; hold.\n\nPOSITION SLOTS CONSTRAINT: All 4 slots full (2 LONG, 2 SHORT). Cannot open new positions. Must manage existing ones. Counter-trend signals (e.g., XRP LONG, ADA LONG) exist but cannot execute new trades; do not force opposite trend-following trades.\n\nGLOBAL REGIME: Bearish (strength 0.83) supports SHORT bias, but counter-trend opportunities exist. Volume weakness in multiple coins (ADA, LINK, ASTER) reduces confidence. No cooldowns active.\n\nDECISION RATIONALE: Close weakest positions (ASTER, ADA) due to loss, weak volume, and reversal risks. Maintain XRP and DOGE as they are profitable with stronger setups. No new entries possible.\n[Position Limit: Cycle 218 - Max 4 positions allowed]",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish (strength 0.83), with 5 bearish coins and 1 neutral. Position slots: 2 LONG positions open (XRP, ADA), 0 SHORT positions open. LONG slots full (0 available), SHORT slots available (2). Constraint: Do NOT force SHORT trades unless LOW/MEDIUM risk with high confidence. Counter-trend signals exist for several coins but cannot be executed due to LONG slots full; per rules, do not open trend-following SHORTs if counter-trend LONG is blocked. Volume weakness noted for DOGE, ASTER, ADA (ratio <0.5x). Reversal signals checked for existing positions: XRP has no reversal, ADA has htf and 3m reversal (MEDIUM strength), consider closing if PnL negative. Cooldowns: None active. Directional performance: LONG net PnL positive (+0.86), SHORT negative (-0.59).\n\nXRP: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2038 > EMA20=2.18896, RSI 56.13), 15m BULLISH (price=2.211 > EMA20=2.18991, RSI 74.1), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2038 > EMA20=2.1992, RSI 61.18). All timeframes aligned bullish with normal volume (ratio 1.08). Existing LONG position with unrealized PnL -0.77. No reversal signals; hold position. Invalidation condition not met (1h price > EMA20). Confidence high for continuation.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.14943 < EMA20=0.15003, RSI 44.06), 15m BULLISH (price=0.14951 > EMA20=0.14934, RSI 52.44), 3m BULLISH (price=0.14943 > EMA20=0.14925, RSI 59.86). Counter-trend LONG setup (15m+3m bullish vs 1h bearish) with STRONG alignment, but volume weak (ratio 0.46). Risk MEDIUM. Cannot open LONG due to slots full; per rules, do not open SHORT. Hold.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.088 < EMA20=1.09557, RSI 44.73), 15m BEARISH (price=1.087 < EMA20=1.09203, RSI 36.66), 3m BULLISH (price=1.088 > EMA20=1.08651, RSI 54.68). Mixed signals; 15m bearish, 3m bullish. Volume weak (ratio 0.28). Risk HIGH. No clear edge; hold.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4179 < EMA20=0.41905, RSI 44.53), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4188 > EMA20=0.41673, RSI 62.17), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4179 > EMA20=0.41744, RSI 58.66). Counter-trend LONG setup (15m+3m bullish vs 1h bearish) with STRONG alignment, but volume weak (ratio 0.17). Existing LONG position with unrealized PnL -0.18. Reversal signals: htf and 3m reversal (MEDIUM strength). Invalidation condition not met (1h price > EMA20), but PnL negative and reversal suggests closing. Confidence reduced; close position.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=13.14 < EMA20=13.14997, RSI 47.37), 15m BULLISH (price=13.15 > EMA20=13.10815, RSI 60.3), 3m BULLISH (price=13.14 > EMA20=13.12699, RSI 57.3). Counter-trend LONG setup (15m+3m bullish vs 1h bearish) with STRONG alignment and strong volume (ratio 2.59). Risk LOW. Cannot open LONG due to slots full; per rules, do not open SHORT. Hold.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=137.28 < EMA20=137.76273, RSI 43.08), 15m BULLISH (price=137.33 > EMA20=137.03547, RSI 56.23), 3m BULLISH (price=137.28 > EMA20=137.04837, RSI 65.3).

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish (strength 0.83), with 5 bearish coins and 1 neutral. Position slots: 2 LONG positions open (XRP, ADA), 0 SHORT positions open, 0 long slots available, 2 short slots available. Constraint: LONG_FULL_SHORT_AVAILABLE - do NOT force trades in SHORT direction unless LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK (high confidence alone not enough). Counter-trade analysis shows several coins with alignment_strength STRONG/MEDIUM but risk levels vary. Trend reversal data indicates MEDIUM reversal signals for DOGE and ADA (existing long), suggesting caution. Volume analysis: ASTER has STRONG volume, DOGE/ADA/SOL NORMAL, XRP/LINK WEAK (volume ratio ≤0.20x for LINK, reduce confidence).\n\nXRP: 1h BULLISH (price=2.2081 > EMA20=2.1914, RSI 57.2), 15m BULLISH (price=2.2139 > EMA20=2.1922, RSI 75.8), 3m BULLISH (price=2.2139 > EMA20=2.2058, RSI 64.7). All timeframes aligned bullish. Existing LONG position with unrealized PnL positive. Volume WEAK (ratio 0.38), but trend strong. No reversal signals.

Counter-trend setup: 15m+3m bullish against 1h bearish. Alignment_strength STRONG, risk_level MEDIUM, volume NORMAL. Valid counter-trend LONG opportunity, but long slots full (0 available). Per constraint, cannot open LONG, and MUST NOT open SHORT (counter-trend signal invalidates trend-following). HOLD.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=1.085 < EMA20=1.0946, RSI 43.0), 15m BEARISH (price=1.084 < EMA20=1.0914, RSI 33.6), 3m BEARISH (price=1.084 < EMA20=1.0867, RSI 40.6). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume STRONG (ratio 2.17). Trend-following SHORT setup with strong volume support. Risk_level VERY_HIGH_RISK, but slots available for SHORT. Confidence reduced due to high risk, but volume strength compensates. Consider SHORT entry.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.4183 < EMA20=0.4190, RSI 45.5), 15m BULLISH (price=0.4187 > EMA20=0.4169, RSI 61.1), 3m BULLISH (price=0.4187 > EMA20=0.4181, RSI 61.6). Counter-trend setup: 15m+3m bullish against 1h bearish. Existing LONG position with unrealized PnL positive. Reversal signals: htf_reversal true, 3m_reversal true, strength MEDIUM, loss_risk_signal MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK. Volume NORMAL. Consider closing due to reversal signals against position.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=13.15 < EMA20=13.1508, RSI 48.2), 15m BULLISH (price=13.13 > EMA20=13.1102, RSI 55.0), 3m BEARISH (price=13.13 < EMA20=13.1389, RSI 48.3). Mixed signals: 15m bullish, 3m bearish. Alignment_strength MEDIUM, risk_level HIGH_RISK. Volume WEAK (ratio 0.17, ≤0.20x), reduce confidence materially. No clear edge, skip.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=137.24 < EMA20=137.7173, RSI 42.9), 15m BULLISH (price=137.15 > EMA20=137.0464, RSI 51.7), 3m BEARISH (price=137.15 < EMA20=137.172, RSI 51.7). Mixed signals: 15m bullish, 3m bearish. Alignment_strength MEDIUM, risk_level HIGH_RISK. Volume NORMAL. No strong alignment, skip.\n\nDecision Summary: Close ADA due to reversal signals.

All timeframes aligned bearish, supporting existing SHORT position. Volume extremely weak (ratio 0.0003x), but position is profitable (unrealized PnL 0.105). No reversal signals.
