Market consolidating. All coins show oversold conditions on 1h but no strong reversal signals. Volume weak for ASTER (no trade), weak for SOL (caution). Best opportunities: DOGE, ADA, LINK for trend-following SHORTs if confidence >0.4. However, need to check same_direction_limit: currently 1 SHORT (SOL), limit=2, so can open 1 more SHORT.

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish with all coins in BEARISH market regime. Position slots: 1 short position open (SOL), with short_slots_available=1 and long_slots_available=2. No cooldowns active. Counter-trade analysis is empty, indicating no strong counter-trend signals. Trend reversal data shows only 3m reversals with strength 'INFORMATIONAL' for most coins, which is weak and not actionable for entries or exits per rules (only applies to existing positions, and SOL has a 3m reversal but strength is INFORMATIONAL, so no exit needed). Volume analysis: XRP volume ratio 0.50x (NORMAL), DOGE 2.16x (STRONG), ASTER 0.18x (WEAK, below 0.20x hard rule - DO NOT TRADE), ADA 0.29x (WEAK, below 0.50x caution), LINK 2.26x (STRONG), SOL 0.25x (WEAK, below 0.50x caution). For ASTER, volume ratio <= 0.20x, so skip trades entirely. For ADA and SOL, low volume reduces confidence. Analyze each coin: XRP: 1h BEARISH (price=1.991 < EMA20=2.061, RSI=23.4 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=1.998 < EMA20=2.014, RSI=37.8), 3m BEARISH (price=1.991 < EMA20=1.998, RSI=40.1). All timeframes aligned bearish with normal volume. Strong trend-following SHORT setup. DOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.1326 < EMA20=0.1384, RSI=15.5 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.1334 < EMA20=0.1346, RSI=34.6), 3m BEARISH (price=0.1326 < EMA20=0.1332, RSI=37.2). All timeframes aligned bearish with strong volume. Strong trend-following SHORT setup. ASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.902 < EMA20=0.980, RSI=17.6 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.904 < EMA20=0.928, RSI=25.4), 3m BEARISH (price=0.902 < EMA20=0.906, RSI=41.9). All timeframes aligned bearish, but volume ratio 0.18x <= 0.20x, so DO NOT TRADE per hard rule. ADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3723 < EMA20=0.3889, RSI=22.2 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=0.374 < EMA20=0.3776, RSI=36.7), 3m BEARISH (price=0.3723 < EMA20=0.3742, RSI=39.3). All timeframes aligned bearish, but volume ratio 0.29x is weak (0.20-0.50x), reducing confidence. LINK: 1h BEARISH (price=11.78 < EMA20=12.286, RSI=20.9 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=11.84 < EMA20=11.995, RSI=32.4), 3m BEARISH (price=11.78 < EMA20=11.877, RSI=31.3). All timeframes aligned bearish with strong volume. Strong trend-following SHORT setup. SOL: Existing SHORT position with unrealized PnL +0.82. 1h BEARISH (price=123.62 < EMA20=128.292, RSI=20.2 oversold), 15m BEARISH (price=124.12 < EMA20=125.386, RSI=36.5), 3m BEARISH (price=123.62 < EMA20=124.248, RSI=38.6). All timeframes aligned bearish, but volume ratio 0.25x is weak, reducing confidence for new entries. Trend reversal data shows 3m reversal with strength INFORMATIONAL, which is not strong enough to exit per rules (only consider closing if STRONG reversal with 15m+3m against position). Position remains valid. Decision: Prioritize SHORT entries for coins with strong alignment and volume, respecting short_slots_available=1. Best candidates: DOGE (strong volume, high confidence) and LINK (strong volume, high confidence). XRP also strong but volume normal. Choose DOGE as it has strongest volume signal. Do not trade ASTER due to low volume hard rule. ADA and SOL have weak volume, so avoid new entries. Hold existing SOL position. No LONG setups as all coins are bearish and no counter-trend signals.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish with all coins in bearish market regimes. Position slots: 1 short position open (DOGE), with short_slots_available=1, long_slots_available=2, and available_slots=3. No cooldowns active. Counter-trade analysis is empty, indicating no explicit counter-trade signals. Trend reversal data shows some 3m reversals but mostly informational or medium strength, not strong enough to override trends. Volume analysis: XRP, DOGE, LINK, SOL have weak volume (ratio <0.5x), ASTER and ADA have normal volume. Weak volume reduces confidence per rules. Analyze each coin:\n\nXRP: 1h bearish (price=1.9978 < EMA20=2.0547, RSI=26.4 oversold), 15m bearish (price=1.9978 < EMA20=2.0115, RSI=39.3), 3m mixed (price=1.9978 > EMA20=1.9967, RSI=49.2 near neutral). All timeframes not aligned; 3m shows slight bullish divergence but volume weak (0.40x). No strong trend-following or counter-trend setup. Reversal signal: 3m reversal strength=MEDIUM, but current_trend_3m=BULLISH, indicating potential counter-trend LONG opportunity. However, risk_level from reversal data is MEDIUM_LOSS_RISK, and volume is weak, reducing confidence. Counter-trend rules: risk_level=MEDIUM_RISK requires confidence >0.65; with weak volume, confidence insufficient. Hold.\n\nDOGE: Has existing short position with unrealized PnL=-0.47232. 1h bearish (price=0.1328 < EMA20=0.1379, RSI=18.7 oversold), 15m bearish (price=0.1328 < EMA20=0.1343, RSI=34.1), 3m bearish (price=0.1328 < EMA20=0.1330, RSI=43.8). All timeframes aligned bearish, supporting current short. Volume weak (0.46x). Reversal signals: none. Hold position; consider closing if reversal strengthens, but currently no strong reversal.\n\nASTER: 1h bearish (price=0.902 < EMA20=0.9727, RSI=18.9 oversold), 15m bearish (price=0.902 < EMA20=0.9250, RSI=26.2), 3m bearish (price=0.902 < EMA20=0.9046, RSI=43.6). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume normal (0.69x). Reversal signal: 3m reversal strength=INFORMATIONAL, not strong. Potential trend-following SHORT setup with good alignment and volume. However, check position slots: short_slots_available=1, so can open new short. Confidence moderate due to bearish alignment but oversold RSI may limit downside. Set confidence 0.6.\n\nADA: 1h bearish (price=0.3736 < EMA20=0.3874, RSI=25.2 oversold), 15m bearish (price=0.3736 < EMA20=0.3770, RSI=38.2), 3m mixed (price=0.3736 < EMA20=0.3738, RSI=47.1 near neutral). Not fully aligned; 3m shows potential bullish divergence but volume normal. Reversal signal: 3m reversal strength=INFORMATIONAL. No strong setup. Hold.\n\nLINK: 1h bearish (price=11.8 < EMA20=12.2391, RSI=22.9 oversold), 15m bearish (price=11.8 < EMA20=11.9704, RSI=32.2), 3m bearish (price=11.8 < EMA20=11.8506, RSI=38.0). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume weak (0.22x), which is a hard rule: volume ratio <=0.20x average do not trade; here 0.22x is above but still weak, reducing confidence significantly. Avoid trade due to low volume caution.\n\nSOL: 1h bearish (price=123.95 < EMA20=127.8709, RSI=23.3 oversold), 15m bearish (price=123.94 < EMA20=125.1973, RSI=37.0), 3m bearish (price=123.94 < EMA20=124.0956, RSI=45.3). All timeframes aligned bearish. Volume weak (0.39x). Reversal signals: none. Potential trend-following SHORT, but volume weak reduces confidence. Since short_slots_available=1, could consider, but ASTER offers better volume. Prefer ASTER for short entry.\n\nOverall, best opportunity: ASTER short entry with aligned bearish signals and normal volume. XRP has counter-trend potential but insufficient confidence. Manage existing DOGE position. No long entries due to bearish regimes and lack of strong bullish setups.",

Hold.\n\nADA: No position. 1h BEARISH (price=0.3736 < EMA20=0.3874, RSI 25.2), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3744 < EMA20=0.3768, RSI 40.5), 3m NEUTRAL (price=0.3738 ≈ EMA20=0.3740, RSI 47.3). 3m shows potential bullish divergence (RSI rising), but volume ratio 0.12x (WEAK). TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL (strength INFORMATIONAL), but not strong enough for counter-trend entry. POSITION_SLOTS: short_slots_available=0, so cannot open SHORT. No clear edge for LONG (confidence low due to weak volume and only 3m signal).

TREND_REVERSAL_DATA shows 3m reversal MEDIUM (strength MEDIUM) with current_trend_3m BULLISH, indicating counter-trend LONG opportunity. However, volume ratio 0.055x (WEAK) is below 0.20x threshold, so DO NOT TRADE per volume rules. POSITION_SLOTS: short_slots_available=0, so cannot open SHORT. Hold due to low volume.\n\nOverall: Market regime BEARISH globally. Two existing SHORT positions (XRP, DOGE) performing well. Short slots full (2/2), long slots available (2). No high-confidence LONG setups due to weak volume across all coins. Discipline: Do not force trades; hold cash when no clear edge.",

    "chain_of_thoughts": "Advanced systematic analysis of all assets using 1h (htf) trends, 15m momentum confirmation, and 3m entry timing. Global regime is bearish with all coins in BEARISH market regime. Position slots: 2 short positions open (XRP and DOGE), short slots full (0 available), long slots available (2). Constraint: short slots full, so no new SHORT entries allowed. Must evaluate LONG opportunities only if they are LOW_RISK or MEDIUM_RISK with high confidence; trend-following SHORTs are blocked. Counter-trade analysis is empty, but reversal data indicates some 3m reversals. Volume analysis: XRP, ADA, LINK, SOL have weak volume (ratio <=0.50x), reducing confidence; DOGE and ASTER have normal volume. Risk management: HARD MARGIN STOP LOSS at 3-7% loss, so stops must be tight. Performance: short bias profitable, but current positions: XRP in loss (-0.33 PnL) with 3m reversal MEDIUM strength against short, DOGE in profit with low risk. Analyze each coin for LONG setups or hold decisions.\n\nXRP: 1h BEARISH (price=1.9978 < EMA20=2.0547, RSI 26.4), 15m BEARISH (price=1.9945 < EMA20=2.0094, RSI 37.2), 3m BULLISH (price=1.9965 > EMA20=1.9958, RSI 49.3). 3m reversal MEDIUM strength against short position. Volume weak (0.29x). Counter-trend LONG opportunity? 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m bullish: alignment only at 3m, not strong. Risk level: MEDIUM_RISK (3m alignment but weak volume). Confidence low due to volume and only 3m support. No LONG entry as slots full for SHORT, but consider closing XRP short? Reversal strength MEDIUM, PnL negative, so close position to cut loss. Invalidation condition already met? Price not above 1h EMA20 yet. Close based on 3m reversal and negative PnL.\n\nDOGE: 1h BEARISH (price=0.1328 < EMA20=0.1379, RSI 18.7), 15m BEARISH (price=0.13283 < EMA20=0.1342, RSI 34.4), 3m BEARISH (price=0.13261 < EMA20=0.1329, RSI 42.7). All timeframes bearish, volume normal. 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL only. Position in profit, hold. No LONG setup as trend bearish.\n\nASTER: 1h BEARISH (price=0.902 < EMA20=0.9727, RSI 18.9), 15m BEARISH (price=0.889 < EMA20=0.9208, RSI 20.1), 3m BEARISH (price=0.888 < EMA20=0.897, RSI 36.6). All bearish, volume normal. No reversal signals. Counter-trend LONG? Risk level: HIGH_RISK (no alignment, trend strong bearish). Do not trade.\n\nADA: 1h BEARISH (price=0.3736 < EMA20=0.3874, RSI 25.2), 15m BEARISH (price=0.3744 < EMA20=0.3768, RSI 40.5), 3m BULLISH (price=0.3745 > EMA20=0.3741, RSI 51.3). 3m reversal MEDIUM strength. Volume weak (0.32x). Counter-trend LONG opportunity? 1h bearish, 15m bearish, 3m bullish: similar to XRP. Risk level: MEDIUM_RISK. Confidence low due to volume. Long slots available, but need confidence >0.65 for MEDIUM_RISK? Strategy says execute if confidence >0.65 for MEDIUM_RISK. Current confidence estimated 0.5 (weak volume, only 3m support). Do not enter.\n\nLINK: 1h BEARISH (price=11.8 < EMA20=12.2391, RSI 22.9), 15m BEARISH (price=11.81 < EMA20=11.9551, RSI 33.4), 3m BEARISH (price=11.79 < EMA20=11.8222, RSI 38.6). All bearish, volume weak (0.18x). 3m reversal INFORMATIONAL. No LONG setup.\n\nSOL: 1h BEARISH (price=123.95 < EMA20=127.8709, RSI 23.3), 15m BEARISH (price=124.06 < EMA20=125.0881, RSI 38.2), 3m BULLISH (price=124.44 > EMA20=124.1347, RSI 54.4). 3m reversal MEDIUM strength. Volume weak (0.33x). Counter-trend LONG opportunity? Risk level: MEDIUM_RISK. Confidence low due to volume. Similar to ADA, confidence estimated 0.5. Do not enter.\n\nOverall: Close XRP short due to negative PnL and 3m reversal. Hold DOGE. No new entries due to slot constraints or low confidence.",
