RSI at 55.68 suggests neutral momentum. MACD is positive but declining. The 3m data shows recent weakness with RSI dropping to 42. My current position is at breakeven. The invalidation condition (4h close below EMA20) hasn't been triggered yet. Given the marginal position above EMA20 and declining momentum, this is concerning.\n\nDOGE: Strong bearish 4h trend with price (0.1923) well below EMA20 (0.1970). RSI at 37.85 shows oversold conditions. MACD is negative and declining. Funding rate is negative. While oversold, the trend is clearly down and I should avoid catching falling knives.\n\nASTR: Similar bearish 4h structure with price (0.0174) below EMA20 (0.0176). RSI at 41.45 shows weakness. Very low volatility and negative funding. No compelling reason to enter.\n\nADA: Bearish 4h trend with price (0.6428) significantly below EMA20 (0.6553). RSI at 39.9 shows oversold conditions. MACD negative and declining. Negative momentum persists.\n\nLINK: Mixed signals. 4h price (18.09) is below EMA20 (18.12) but close. RSI at 49.6 is neutral. MACD is negative but flattening. Funding rate is positive at 0.01%. Not a clear trend direction.\n\nSOL: Bearish 4h trend with price (195.22) below EMA20 (196.998). RSI at 47 shows weakness. MACD positive but declining rapidly. The 3m data shows continued selling pressure.\n\nGiven my existing XRP position is at risk of breaking the 4h EMA20 support, and the broader market shows bearish tendencies across most assets, I should close the XRP position to preserve capital.

Open Interest high, positive funding. However, current price is near recent highs and 3m RSI overbought suggests potential pullback. Better to wait for better entry.\n\nDOGE: 4h trend bearish (price 0.1952 < EMA20 0.1973), MACD negative, RSI 44.917 weak. 3m shows strong rally with RSI 89.729 extremely overbought.

Profit target at 18.65 is reasonable (1.5% from current). Stop loss at 17.65 still valid. Given the strong momentum and 4h trend improvement, holding makes sense but watching for overbought reversal.\n\nSOL: 4h trend neutral (price 197.99 \u2248 EMA20 197.262), MACD positive but flat, RSI 52.836 neutral. 3m shows good momentum with RSI 81.677 overbought but not extreme. Positive funding. Could be setting up for continuation but needs more confirmation.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT: LINK position is small ($4 notional) and profitable. Current plan remains valid. No other assets show clear low-risk entries given overbought conditions on most and conflicting signals.",

Funding rate positive. Current position near recent highs but 4h trend remains supportive.\n\nDOGE: 4h trend bearish - price (0.1951) below EMA20 (0.1973), MACD negative, RSI(14) at 44.8 (weak). 3m shows strong momentum but likely counter-trend bounce. Negative funding rate suggests short bias. Avoid trading against 4h downtrend.\n\nASTR: 4h trend neutral-bearish - price (0.0176) near EMA20 (0.0177), MACD negative, RSI(14) at 48.2. 3m shows overbought RSI(7) at 78.1. Negative funding rate. Limited volatility and weak momentum - avoid.\n\nADA: 4h trend bearish - price (0.6524) below EMA20 (0.6562), MACD negative, RSI(14) at 47.0. 3m shows strong momentum but RSI(7) cooling from 78.3. Positive funding rate but weak 4h structure - avoid.\n\nLINK (OPEN POSITION): Position is profitable (+$0.06). Current price (18.39) above entry (18.10). 4h trend improving - price above EMA20 (18.15), MACD turning positive, RSI(14) at 55.9. 3m shows strong momentum but RSI(7) cooling to 73.7. Profit target (18.65) is ~1.4% away, stop loss (17.65) provides good risk management. Position remains valid.\n\nSOL: 4h trend neutral - price (197.67) near EMA20 (197.23), MACD positive but declining, RSI(14) at 52.2. 3m shows momentum cooling with RSI(7) at 65.4. Very low funding rate. Mixed signals - no clear edge.\n\nGiven the analysis, I'll maintain the LINK position as it aligns with improving 4h trend and has proper risk management in place. No new positions as other assets either show weak 4h trends or lack clear entry signals.",
