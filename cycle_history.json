        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me analyze each asset systematically:\n\nXRP: I have an existing LONG position. The 4h trend shows price (2.6292) is above EMA20 (2.6196) but barely. RSI at 55.68 suggests neutral momentum. MACD is positive but declining. The 3m data shows recent weakness with RSI dropping to 42. My current position is at breakeven. The invalidation condition (4h close below EMA20) hasn't been triggered yet. Given the marginal position above EMA20 and declining momentum, this is concerning.\n\nDOGE: Strong bearish 4h trend with price (0.1923) well below EMA20 (0.1970). RSI at 37.85 shows oversold conditions. MACD is negative and declining. Funding rate is negative. While oversold, the trend is clearly down and I should avoid catching falling knives.\n\nASTR: Similar bearish 4h structure with price (0.0174) below EMA20 (0.0176). RSI at 41.45 shows weakness. Very low volatility and negative funding. No compelling reason to enter.\n\nADA: Bearish 4h trend with price (0.6428) significantly below EMA20 (0.6553). RSI at 39.9 shows oversold conditions. MACD negative and declining. Negative momentum persists.\n\nLINK: Mixed signals. 4h price (18.09) is below EMA20 (18.12) but close. RSI at 49.6 is neutral. MACD is negative but flattening. Funding rate is positive at 0.01%. Not a clear trend direction.\n\nSOL: Bearish 4h trend with price (195.22) below EMA20 (196.998). RSI at 47 shows weakness. MACD positive but declining rapidly. The 3m data shows continued selling pressure.\n\nGiven my existing XRP position is at risk of breaking the 4h EMA20 support, and the broader market shows bearish tendencies across most assets, I should close the XRP position to preserve capital. No new entries make sense in this environment as most assets are in downtrends or showing weak momentum.",
