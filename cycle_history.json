        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me analyze each asset systematically:\n\nXRP: \n- 4h trend appears bullish with price (2.6294) above EMA20 (2.6196) and RSI at 55.72\n- 3m shows recent weakness with RSI(7) dropping to 43.23 and MACD declining from 0.0013 to 0.0010\n- Funding rate positive at 0.0038% suggests long bias\n- Current price near recent lows in 3m timeframe\n\nDOGE:\n- 4h trend clearly bearish with price (0.1924) below declining EMA20 (0.1970) and RSI weak at 38.32\n- 3m shows some stabilization but MACD flat, negative funding rate (-0.0073%)\n- Strong downtrend on 4h, avoid longs\n\nASTR:\n- Price completely flat at 0.0174 across all recent 3m candles, no volatility\n- 4h shows downtrend with price below EMA20 (0.0176), negative funding rate (-0.0171%)\n- No trading opportunity due to lack of movement\n\nADA:\n- 4h trend bearish with price (0.6429) well below declining EMA20 (0.6553), RSI weak at 39.98\n- 3m shows some bounce attempts but MACD remains weak\n- Strong downtrend, avoid longs\n\nLINK:\n- 4h trend mixed but leaning bearish with price (18.06) below EMA20 (18.1178), RSI at 48.90\n- 3m shows recent selling pressure with RSI(7) dropping to 30.59\n- Funding rate positive but technicals weak\n\nSOL:\n- 4h trend bearish with price (195.14) below EMA20 (196.99), RSI at 46.85\n- 3m shows continued weakness with declining MACD and RSI(7) at 40.05\n- Strong downtrend across timeframes\n\nGiven the overall bearish 4h trends for most assets and the fact this is my first trade, I'll look for the strongest setup. XRP shows the most promising setup with:\n- 4h uptrend (price above EMA20)\n- Positive funding rate\n- Recent 3m pullback creating potential entry near support\n- Using 4h ATR of 0.0456 for stop-loss calculation: SL at 2.6294 - (0.0456 \u00d7 1.5) = 2.561, profit target at 2.6294 + (0.0456 \u00d7 2.25) = 2.732 for 1:1.5 R/R",

        "chain_of_thoughts": "Let me analyze each asset systematically:\n\nXRP: I have an existing LONG position. The 4h trend shows price (2.6292) is above EMA20 (2.6196) but barely. RSI at 55.68 suggests neutral momentum. MACD is positive but declining. The 3m data shows recent weakness with RSI dropping to 42. My current position is at breakeven. The invalidation condition (4h close below EMA20) hasn't been triggered yet. Given the marginal position above EMA20 and declining momentum, this is concerning.\n\nDOGE: Strong bearish 4h trend with price (0.1923) well below EMA20 (0.1970). RSI at 37.85 shows oversold conditions. MACD is negative and declining. Funding rate is negative. While oversold, the trend is clearly down and I should avoid catching falling knives.\n\nASTR: Similar bearish 4h structure with price (0.0174) below EMA20 (0.0176). RSI at 41.45 shows weakness. Very low volatility and negative funding. No compelling reason to enter.\n\nADA: Bearish 4h trend with price (0.6428) significantly below EMA20 (0.6553). RSI at 39.9 shows oversold conditions. MACD negative and declining. Negative momentum persists.\n\nLINK: Mixed signals. 4h price (18.09) is below EMA20 (18.12) but close. RSI at 49.6 is neutral. MACD is negative but flattening. Funding rate is positive at 0.01%. Not a clear trend direction.\n\nSOL: Bearish 4h trend with price (195.22) below EMA20 (196.998). RSI at 47 shows weakness. MACD positive but declining rapidly. The 3m data shows continued selling pressure.\n\nGiven my existing XRP position is at risk of breaking the 4h EMA20 support, and the broader market shows bearish tendencies across most assets, I should close the XRP position to preserve capital. No new entries make sense in this environment as most assets are in downtrends or showing weak momentum.",
